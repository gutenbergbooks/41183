<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> little Tale, which the Author has given
permission to be published, was written more
than five-and-twenty years ago, after a residence
of six years in Marocco. The story is
founded on tragical facts, which occurred at
the time, and is intended to illustrate the
character of the people of West Barbary, as
well as the state of oppression under which
the Jews of that country suffered, but which
of late years the Author understands has
been greatly ameliorated, owing to the humane
exertions of Sir Moses Montefiore, and
the remonstrances of the British Government.</p>

<h1>THE ARAB'S PLEDGE.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE CONSPIRACY.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/002.png" width="70" height="70" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">ur</span> scene is in Marocco, and the reader will,
I trust, pardon details of dress and scenery
which may appear tedious, but are necessary
in the delineation of the manners and customs of a
people who, though so close at our doors, are so little
known as the Moors, Jews, and Arabs of West
Barbary.</p>

<p>The town of Marocco lies at the foot of the Atlas,
which rises in grand, imposing masses to the eastward,
piercing the sky with its snowy peaks. Around the
town are extensive groves of date-palms, plantations
of olives, gardens and orchards abounding with
apricots, pomegranates, grapes, oranges, quinces, and
jujubes, as well as flowers; which latter, however, are
never cultivated with any care and grow almost wild.
Beyond, extend the plains, varied by evergreen woods
and tracts of cultivation, nearly to the sea-coast.
These plains are barren during the greater part of the
year, but after the periodical rains of spring, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
carpeted with grass and wild flowers; and afford
pasture to herds of gazelles, which at that season
forsake the vicinity of the rivers and bound joyously
over their free expanse.</p>

<p>The Jews, whom this tale principally concerns,
live among the fanatic Moors in a state of most abject
degradation. They are compelled to wear a distinguishing
dress with the indispensable badge of a black
cap and shoes; they must take off their shoes and
walk barefoot in passing before mosques, official
residences, gates of towns, and in presence of any
persons in authority; the wealthiest Jews may be
loaded with abuse, and even struck by the lowest
Moors without daring to retaliate or raise their hand
in self-defence, the penalty for striking a Moslem
being amputation of the hand. On the slightest
pretext they are thrown into prison for the sake of
their wealth, and then tortured to extort a heavy
ransom for their deliverance. But their greatest
danger arises from the terms of the Mohammedan
law; in accordance with which if two witnesses swear
that a Jew has repeated the words of their confession
of faith, "I believe there is but one God, and
Mohammed is the prophet of God," his denial is worthless,
as the evidence of Jews is not admitted against
Moors: he is at once invested with a Moorish dress
and forced to conform to Moslem rites, under peril, in
case of refusal or recantation, of being burnt alive.</p>

<p>The gardens before mentioned are the resort of the
towns-people, who come out to enjoy the coolness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
evening after the heat and dust of the streets. In one
of these a natural arbour was formed by several grape-vines,
which after climbing up the shafts of the date-trees
for fifteen or twenty feet had lost their hold, and
with interlaced boughs and tendrils, sloped back in a
curtain of foliage supported by thick shrubs of jujube
and arbutus, gemmed with waxen berries of yellow and
crimson; from the festoons above hung a profusion of
half-ripe, blushing grapes. The grassy floor of this
bower lay in deep cool shade. Two Moors had
selected this inviting spot to spread their carpet. In
front of them, where the trees had been cleared away
to plant the ground with melons and Indian corn,
opened an extensive view of the snow-capped Atlas
and the city of Marocco; its mud walls hidden by a
canopy of white dust and vapour, above which rose
the minarets of the mosques, the chief of which, the
Juma Kitibea, towered in proud pre-eminence.</p>

<p>These two persons, who are likely to be prominent
actors on our scene, showed by their dress and
appearance that they were soldiers of the Sultan's
army. Over a coat of red cloth they wore a full white
shirt with open sleeves, confined round the waist
by a red sash, full white trousers to the knee, and on
the head a tall red cap with a blue silk tassel; yellow
slippers completed their costume, and over all they wore
the white hooded burnoose. They carried silver-chased
ataghans in their belts; their swords and guns
were leaning against the trees; their horses, with
saddles of faded red, were picketed among the long grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder of the two, Abdslem Ibn Hadj, was a
short thick-set mulatto, whose grisly black mustachios
and beard gave a fierce expression to a countenance
which was otherwise a picture of treachery and
cunning. The other was a young man of pale complexion,
with a fine cast of features and a noble form;
he was originally of an amiable and retiring disposition;
but this had been greatly changed by his association
with a dissolute soldiery. He was the son of a man of
rank; his father had for many years been Ka&iuml;d of a
large province, and being suspected of having amassed
wealth, was, according to the arbitrary custom of the
country, thrown into prison, his property confiscated,
and his son forced to serve in the capacity of a
common soldier. The father did not long survive his
disgrace.</p>

<p>This oppression rankled in the heart of Hassan,
and nearly overcame every remnant of moral principle
in his mind. He saw that honour and religion were
only used as a veil for the greatest enormities, and
that self was the great idol of prince and beggar;
watching every opportunity for revenge, he had become
mixed up with Abdslem, whom he had foolishly
trusted, in plots against the Sultan who had injured
him.</p>

<p>The two friends, having filled their pipes with
hashish, threw themselves on the carpet, while a negro
boy, who had accompanied them on a mule, produced
from his panniers provisions, dried fruits, and some
charcoal, with which he made a fire in a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ground to prepare tea,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> an indispensable beverage in
every Moorish party.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The diversity of national beverages is curious. The
Moors drink <i>green</i> tea; the Persians, <i>black</i> tea; the Turks,
<i>coffee</i>; as the French affect <i>wine</i>, and the English <i>beer</i>.</p></div>

<p>Abdslem, whose intellects were getting confused
with the intoxicating drug he was smoking, began
talking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"God is great! yes, God is great! oh, wonderful!
What blessings He has bestowed on His servants!
The infidels covet our country; of course, they have
heard how beautiful it is; they can't help it. O the
green grass and running water! Ya Mohammed! O
the noble horses and the graceful girls! Curse on the
infidels! Abdslem Ibn Hadj wears a sword! The
banner of the Prophet waves over us! And where are
their fathers' houses?"</p>

<p>He lay back emitting a thick cloud from his lips,
without observing his companion, who was all the time
immersed in a dark reverie, with his eyes fixed on the
carpet pattern.</p>

<p>"God be praised!" he continued. "What a
splendid view! Look at that mosque! they say its
height is not to be measured. And look at God's
hills; the true believers in Paradise enjoy not greater&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he stopped short, perceiving that he was
talking for his own amusement.</p>

<p>"How now, Hassan! do you come out here to shut
your eyes, or to enjoy God's blessings? Better have
stayed in your fondak smothered with dust and fleas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I'll lay my life your head is still running on that
infidel's daughter, (may her days be shortened!); you
have no more heart than a Christian. O child! if the
men got wind of it, you would be the laugh of the
whole Alfa!"</p>

<p>He checked himself as he saw the other's darkening
brow, which showed him he was going too far
with one who, although his equal in station, was his
superior by birth.</p>

<p>"Well, don't be offended, you know I am your
friend, although <i>I am</i> fond of talking. Try this tea;
the live water of the infidels I prefer, but that is not
easily got."</p>

<p>"May your father's house be desolate!" said Hassan
surlily, putting aside the offered refreshment. "Have
I not curses enough on my head, without that of your
rattling, insulting tongue superadded; if you have no
better entertainment to offer, hold that in the devil's
name?"</p>

<p>"Ya Allah! may the devil be accursed! This is
all I get for my good will. The wise has said, 'He
who loses his temper may drink the sea.' I am silent!"
and calling the boy to replenish the tea-pot, he continued
drinking cup after cup till he had exhausted
the supply, while his companion sat evolving wreaths
of smoke and twisting long grass into cords.</p>

<p>"And now," said Abdslem, turning suddenly
round, "shall I prove to you that I am your
friend?"</p>

<p>Surprised by this sudden address Hassan looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
up with an expression of hope on his face; which,
however, quickly changed to a glance of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Why, Abdslem, if words could do it, you can;
but I have long learnt the value of friendship, which is
bought and sold like market stuff, but ever fails in
time of need,&mdash;unless interested."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Abdslem; "so it is; but hear
me first, and then judge. You love the Jewess!
The Jews were created for slaves to the Moslems!
But you can't buy her; the infidels won't sell their
children with all their love of money; and she won't
turn Moslem; so you can't marry her, it is against the
Koran. She is pretty; it is a wonder how God can
give Jews such beautiful daughters!"</p>

<p>"May your father be burnt! Why do you torment
me thus?" said Hassan, springing up.</p>

<p>"Wait and hear me," said Abdslem; "I have a
plan in which I will the more readily assist as it is to
save a soul from Djehennem. Now mark! try your luck
once more, and if she repulse you, we will go and swear
that she has pronounced the confession of faith of
Islam. The fear of death will prevent her from
retracting; and you will then possess the object of
your wishes at the trifling expense of an oath. There,
have I proved I am your friend? God is great!"</p>

<p>Hassan, whose countenance had brightened when
expecting to hear a way of obtaining the object of his
wishes, although accustomed to wickedness, when he
thus suddenly heard the proposal, revolted at its enormity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friend!" echoed he. "Fiend, say rather! I
thought I had fallen low enough; but I see there are
deeper depths of villany; and <i>you</i>, my <i>friend</i>&mdash;"
he continued, with a bitter sneer, "would still plunge
me downward, until you land me in the lowest pit of
hell; and there you would leave me,&mdash;if you may."</p>

<p>Abdslem was rather staggered at the manner in
which his proposition had been received.</p>

<p>"Wonderful," said he; "I thought to have served
you, and these are my thanks! Well, I will trouble you
no longer with my friendship, or my company. Find
another butt for your spleen; I have borne with you
thus long for your father's sake. Here, bring my
horse, you son of fourteen generations of black fathers,"
he called to the slave boy.</p>

<p>Hassan was touched.</p>

<p>"Stay!" said he, seizing his hand, as he rose to
depart, "forgive me,&mdash;my misfortunes gall me; I speak
at random; leave me not now when I so much need
your assistance."</p>

<p>"I do not bear enmity," said Abdslem; "I only
thought of gratifying your wishes, but if you will not
take what may be had for such small pains, let us
think no more of the infidel. I would rather see all
the Jews in Marocco burnt in their quarter than see
you down-hearted."</p>

<p>"I have trusted you, O my brother," said Hassan,
"with this secret grief; but can we not devise some
other means?" For he was unwilling to give up all
hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see none," said Abdslem. "Open violence
would cost you your head; and fraud would bring you
under the Sultan's hand, and he would not spare your
father's son. What worse are the means that I propose
than the end you aim at? And then the merit
of bringing a Kafir to the true faith!"</p>

<p>"True! there is some reason in that," said Hassan,
whose scruples were fast fading away before his passion,
which blinded his better judgment; and what had at
first revolted him by its criminal deformity, softened
down by familiarity and was stripped of its repulsiveness.</p>

<p>"True, she will thank me hereafter for saving her
from infidelity."</p>

<p>"God be praised!" said Abdslem; "and you will
laugh over it some day, when your 'pearl' is called
Merjana, wife of Hassan; as a praiseworthy stratagem."</p>

<p>They now mounted their horses which were unwillingly
disturbed from their unusual feast on the leafy
drapery that surrounded them; and leaving the boy to
collect their canteen, they rode slowly towards the
town; and before reaching it the artful suggestions of
Abdslem had completed the victory over his companion's
scruples; and the next morning was fixed
upon for putting their plot in execution. As they
entered the gate called Bab Er Rahamna, the eastern sun
threw their shadows far up the street, a symbol of the
darker shadow that their coming cast upon their victim.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>THE ACCUSERS.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/003.png" width="70" height="70" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">he</span> Jews living in the towns of Marocco
occupy a walled quarter, separated by gates
from the rest of the town; physically they
are a fine race, many of them are very wealthy, and
some of the best families show high breeding, but the
cringing and servile habits, to which they are inured
from infancy by oppression, have impressed their
demeanour and physiognomy with timidity and cunning,
and effaced in a great measure the higher and
nobler feelings from their minds. There are partial
exceptions to this, as in the case of some of their
priests and men engaged in European trade, who are
brought less into contact with their masters, and feel
themselves under more protection. The separate
quarter, although affording security in ordinary times,
seems to enhance the danger to its inhabitants in
time of trouble or insurrection, for the moment that
the Sultan's authority is relaxed or in danger, the
mob and the soldiery break loose; urged on by
fanaticism and cupidity, the cry is, "To the Jews'
quarter!" and the place is sacked, as by a foreign
enemy. It is wonderful that men who can afford it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
will submit to live with their families in this constant
state of oppression and terror; but such is the force
of habit and the love of gain,&mdash;for I can hardly place
in the category the love of country,&mdash;that very few, or
none, do leave it. It is true that the law does not
permit them to leave the country, but they might easily
escape or evade it.</p>

<p>The women, seldom leaving their houses, are less
exposed to the degrading influences which lower the
character of the men; their countenance is more open,
and their bearing more independent; as a rule, they
are good-looking, and their manners and address are
graceful and ladylike. Although the prevailing colour
of the race is Andalusian, there are not wanting many
possessing the clear and brilliant complexion of northern
climates, and even blue eyes are not uncommon.</p>

<p>In the Jewish quarter in Marocco, in a small house,
distinguished only from those which surrounded it, by
its cleanliness of exterior and neatness within, lived a
Jewish matron with her only daughter; their appearance
and manners showed them to have belonged to a
higher station, though now reduced to the necessity of
gaining a living by needle-work. The mother was the
widow of a priest, who had been esteemed for his
unostentatious charity, and who had bequeathed to his
daughter little of worldly goods, but instead, a well-grounded
faith in the Scriptural promises and a strong
love for her ancestral religion. The child's personal
beauty as she grew up was looked on by her parents&mdash;as
it foolishly is by most parents&mdash;as a great blessing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
How little did they foresee, while doating on her loveliness,
that they were fostering serpents that would
one day sting her to the soul, and prove her most fatal
curse. She was now about eighteen, a vision of grace
and beauty. Most descriptions of beauty have been
failures, and I will not add another to them by
attempting it, but to see Azora, after her morning
occupation of reading the prophets, her perfect cheek
resting on her perfect hand, her large dark eyes cast
upward, her lovely parted lips partially revealing their
translucent gems, while a glow of enthusiasm lighted
up her beautiful features; the only epithet by which
to describe her beauty is "heavenly." Her dress was
an embroidered spencer of pink damask, over a shirt
of striped muslin, whose ample sleeves nearly reached
the ground, and a frock of dark green cloth edged
with gold lace. A crimson Algerian scarf encircled
her waist, and silver anklets and bracelets attracted
admiration to the limbs they could not adorn. A
light green silk handkerchief was bound round her
forehead, the ends hanging loose behind, and confined
her hair, which fell down her back in long broad
plaits. Her mother's dress was of a similar description,
but of different materials; and, instead of her
hair, which their customs will not allow married
women to show, she wore the flat brush of black
ostrich feathers fastened on each side of the face, under
the head-dress. She was engaged in arranging the
cushions of the divan and their few articles of household
equipment, preparatory to their morning meal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
when Azora tripped joyously in with several garments
she was in course of embroidering on her arm, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>"My blessing on you, my rose of Paradise," said
Rachel.</p>

<p>"May <i>you</i> be blessed, O my mother!" returned
Azora; "and see how much work I have done. Is it
not well done?" and her merry laugh rang out musical,
as she nestled down by her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother, "we shall soon have
earned enough for a dowry worthy of your family,
though your beauty is dowry for a queen!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl stood up in an attitude of
terror; her eyes fixed, and her hand pressed to her
forehead.</p>

<p>"What is it, my child?" cried Rachel, "you
frighten me; are you ill?"</p>

<p>"O my mother," said she, mournfully, "I had
forgotten; I know not what brought back to my mind
horrible dreams, which last night visited me, and
which troubled me as the whisperings of evil spirits."</p>

<p>"You read too much, my child, and spoil your
sleep; but let not dreams trouble you, mere fanciful
flights of the imagination while reason sleeps."</p>

<p>"Yet it is written," she replied, "'In dreams, in
visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon man,
the Lord showeth His will, and sendeth warnings to
His servants.'"</p>

<p>"May the evil be averted!" said her mother;
"but cheer up, my child, and let us put our trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in Him, the Holy One, who holds all under His
hand."</p>

<p>It was some time before Azora could shake off the
indefinite dread of impending evil which oppressed
her; but she gradually recovered her usual cheerfulness,
and, after their frugal repast, they sat down to
their work.</p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon, a knock at the door
was answered with some hesitation by Rachel, who
gave admittance to our two acquaintances of yesterday.
With a lordly air of patronage they sat down, and reclined
on the cushions at the end of the room.</p>

<p>"Peace," said Abdslem; "peace to all true believers.
Well, daughter, is my caftan finished? I
have waited for it long. To-morrow there is a review
and powder-burning. I <i>must</i> have it."</p>

<p>"I trust it will be finished this evening," said
Rachel; while Azora, feeling their eyes fixed upon
her, bent down over her work; "and I hope my lord
will be pleased with it."</p>

<p>"No doubt about that," said Abdslem: "and I
hope you will be as pleased with your pay!" he added
sarcastically, with a look at Hassan; "but I shall
want more braiding in front; and you have not silk
enough. Here, Rachel," said he, in a commanding
tone, "take this dollar, and go to that enemy of God,
Benjamin, and buy enough to complete it; and hear!
don't let him cheat you!"</p>

<p>It had been concerted between them to dismiss the
mother, that they might have a clear field to put their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
plot in execution; and she was no sooner gone, than
Abdslem, feigning business at a house in the vicinity,
and telling his friend to await his return, also departed.
Thus left alone with one, of whose feelings towards
her she was well aware, Azora naturally felt uneasy;
her occupation had brought her into contact occasionally
with Moors of this description; but she had
hitherto managed, by the firmness of her behaviour, to
keep them at a respectful distance; but the importunate
perseverance of Hassan had caused her much
misery and apprehension. Hassan arose; the struggle
in his bosom was fierce and short: he paused; but
his better feelings succumbed to the fire of his
passion.</p>

<p>"Azora," he said, "Azora, I have poured out at
your feet the love that devours me; you have repulsed
me with contempt. Can my undying love not move
you? Have you no pity? Can you see my anguish
without one word of hope? Oh, how I love you!
Azora! Azora, have mercy!" and he clasped his
hands in supplication.</p>

<p>"This is folly," said Azora, who had risen to her
feet. "You are a Moslem; I, a Jewess; what love can
there be between us? Go! and crush out the wicked
thoughts with which you insult me; but talk not of
love;" and a deep blush overspread her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"You will drive me mad," said Hassan, with
concentrated feeling, and his frame trembling with
emotion. "Beware! for I will no longer be fooled;
I am come now for the last time. If I go hence this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
day without a ray of hope, by the holy Koran I swear
you shall live to find that Hassan's spurned love can
only be matched by his hatred and revenge!"</p>

<p>"And is it so?" said Azora, recovering from her
alarm at his increasing violence, but deadly pale.
"Then know that I am no more to be intimidated by
your threats than deceived by your professions. I
know that I am exposed to your violence, but the
Sultan's protection is spread over the poorest of his
subjects!"</p>

<p>"Think not," said Hassan, "that I intend to
break the laws. No! but the law itself shall place
you in my power. And now decide," added he, in a
lower tone, through his clenched teeth, and seizing her
wrist in his grasp; "for, by the sword of the Prophet,
I swear you shall be mine, or perish at the stake!"</p>

<p>"God of Israel! help me!" exclaimed Azora, as
the horrible design now burst upon her mind. Regaining
her self-possession, she replied in a calm tone,
"Then let me perish! There is a God above who will
exact fearful vengeance for innocent blood!"</p>

<p>"On my head be it," said Hassan, with unchecked
rage; and seeing Abdslem, who was now returning,
he rushed out, shouting, "Bear witness, O Moslmeen,
this woman has professed the faith of Islam."</p>

<p>"I have heard it! I have heard it!" said Abdslem.
"To the Cadi!" and collecting a rabble as they
proceeded, they all went off to the tribunal of the
Cadi, to seal by false witness their iniquitous plot.</p>

<p>On their departure, Azora stood riveted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
spot, scarcely able to believe in the reality of what had
occurred; but a sickening chill came over her, as she
began to recollect some part of the dreams which had
so unaccountably affected her. Presently her mother
returned, and, seeing her daughter pale and speechless,
her hand pressed to her head, the purchases dropped
to the ground, and she clasped her child in her arms.</p>

<p>"My child! my child! what has happened? Oh,
speak!"</p>

<p>"The dream! O my mother! The dream! We
are lost&mdash;lost&mdash;and ruined!" and, leaning her bursting
head on her mother's shoulder, through sobs and
tears she told her, in broken sentences, the conspiracy
of the Moors against her honour and her life.</p>

<p>"Shall the curse cleave to our race for ever?" said
Rachel. "But, no; they shall not take you from
me;" and she clasped the affrighted girl more closely
to her bosom, as they heard the sound of voices, and
the approach of a crowd in the street.</p>

<p>"They cannot&mdash;they dare not!"</p>

<p>By this time the return of Abdslem, with the Cadi's
soldiers, to summon Azora to the presence of that
functionary, put an end to her lamentations; and forgetting
her caution and the usual respect to be shown
to a Moslem, she endeavoured to assuage her grief by
uselessly aggravating their oppressors.</p>

<p>"Oh! may a mother's curse light on you and yours!
May your children be fatherless, and your wife a widow.
Had your eye (sleepless be it ever) no pity? Could
you not spare my innocent child? Perjured slave!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
reprobate scum of the children of Edom&mdash;may every
curse that ever came out of the mouth of man be
poured in one appalling mass on your devoted head!
O Lord of Hosts! hear me!"</p>

<p>These curses were poured out, half in Hebrew
half in Arabic, as she stood with one arm round
her daughter, and the other raised to heaven! She
looked an inspired prophetess expecting the thunderbolt
to seal her denunciation.</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed Abdslem to the appalled bystanders&mdash;"be
witness to her curses, and to me,&mdash;a
Moslem!&mdash;Woman, your curses be on your own
head. What is written will happen! If the Prophet,
(on whom peace,) has enlightened your daughter's
mind with the truth of Islam, and she wishes
to leave your worn-out religion, what is it to me?
The praise be to God, what is written must be!"</p>

<p>"A lie! he knows it a lie," said Azora. "I was
born a Jewess, and so I will die! and I go not except
by force!"</p>

<p>"Then force it shall be;" and with the help of
the soldiers, and in spite of her screams and resistance,
they tore her from her mother, who, overcome with
anguish, swooned in the arms of the women who had
collected and looked on in terror. Abdslem then threw
her hayk over Azora (for he would not take a woman
through the streets unveiled) and led her off in triumph,
the crowd that followed chanting as they went along&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"La illaw il Allaw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mohammed er rasool Allaw!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Azora had often heard this chanted at the Moorish
funerals, and she now felt it as the knell of death.</p>

<p>The Cadi was sitting in the gate of the town,
where he usually administered justice; these gates have
side arched recesses where the guards are quartered
and are very convenient for the transaction of such
business. The Cadi was a fine-looking old man, his
white turban was without a plait, and he was enveloped
in a fine woollen hayk. The crowd had been beaten
off by the guards, and Azora stood before the Cadi
almost unconscious of what was passing around her.
The oaths of Hassan and Abdslem were carefully
written down with a reed pen, and sworn on the
Koran, which was reverently held above the waist, and
then restored to the case in which it was kept. "God
be praised!" said the Cadi, "God be praised. For
you, my daughter, my heart is joyful for your conversion.
Ya Mohammed&mdash;glory to the Prophet, he
has saved you from Djehennem, your name shall be
changed;&mdash;and Hassan, he is a good youth, Hassan,&mdash;and
a good Moslem,&mdash;he shall take charge of you,
and instruct you in the Koran,&mdash;a good sponsor."</p>

<p>Hassan's countenance was beaming with satisfaction,
and he already congratulated himself on his
success; he little knew the heroic spirit that dwelt in
that fair form.</p>

<p>"But I forget," said the Cadi, "we must go
through the forms of the law,&mdash;I grow old. Sidi Abd el Kader Jilelly,
protect me. Come, my daughter,
and repeat the profession of faith, 'La illaw&mdash;'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Azora had stood motionless while her accusers gave
in their lying witness, and an appalling sense of the
danger of her position crept over her, as she found
herself, a helpless girl, in such ruthless hands; but at
this point she summoned resolution to speak.</p>

<p>"What these perjured men lay on my head," she
said solemnly, "is false&mdash;<i>utterly false</i>, and never will
I be guilty of becoming an apostate from the faith of
my fathers!"</p>

<p>"May evil be averted!" ejaculated the Cadi, pushing
his spectacles upon his forehead; "this is another
story, and alters the case." And here he cast a glance
of scrutiny at the witnesses, whose involuntary confusion
showed him at once that the charge was false;
but he was a Moor, and a fanatic, and covetous withal,
and with such adepts at bribery, it required very little
by-play to make him see his profit in the transaction.
"Daughter," said he, severely, "they have sworn; they
are Moslem&mdash;you cannot retract when you have once
said it. Hear the law,"&mdash;and he again took the Koran
from its case, and turning over the leaves, intoned a
long passage in Arabic, "'If any shall confess the faith
of Islam, and afterwards relapse, the infidel shall be
burnt,' &amp;c., &amp;c. That is the penalty of obstinacy. Are
you prepared to forfeit your life? Speak! I await your
decision." But Azora remained stunned. "Away with
the Infidel!" cried the Cadi. "To prison with her!"
and the guards advanced to obey his orders. Just then
a ray of hope flashed on her mind.</p>

<p>"Stop! my lord judge," said she; "I <i>will</i> not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
submit to <i>your</i> unjust decision. I hereby appeal to
our Lord the Sultan; <i>he</i> will see justice done to the
helpless and oppressed."</p>

<p>This was her last resource. An appeal to the
Sultan, publicly made, cannot be passed over, and
she thus removed herself and her cause from the
hands of her persecutors. Hassan was foiled, but, unwilling
to expose his feelings in public, he hastily left
the place, in no very enviable state of mind, followed
by Abdslem. The Cadi, though feeling his dignity
offended, was obliged to put a good face on the matter.
Muttering some unscriptural phrases against the protection
given by the Sultan to the infidels, he directed
Azora to be consigned to the women of his own
hareem until her cause could be submitted to the
Sultan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>THE PLEDGE.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/004.png" width="70" height="70" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">s</span> soon as Rachel recovered her consciousness,
the poor mother looked round in vain for
her child, and felt almost crushed by her
desolation, but soon, with that elasticity of feeling so
providentially given to her race, she began to turn
over in her mind the means of rescuing Azora from
what she could not conceal from herself was most imminent
danger. She pondered long and deeply. The
first object was to raise money; for, in a country like
this, she knew that bribery was the first, if not, the
first and last, means of success; and she at once began
collecting all their little articles of jewellery, and what
money was in her possession. While turning out the
contents of one or two small trunks, in which she kept
what she possessed of value, her eye was arrested by
the sight of a small green velvet pouch, four or five
inches square, ornamented with tarnished embroidery,
such as is commonly used for carrying flint and steel.</p>

<p>"The Pledge!" exclaimed Rachel, her face brightening
with hope; "as my soul liveth, this is not sent
to me for nought in my hour of peril. The Arab's
Pledge! Oh! he will save us! But where to find him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Alas! he may be a month's journey in the Desert&mdash;but
no! now I remember I heard that he was marching
with the tribes against the south, and was already
at Tafilelt."</p>

<p>She immediately sent to call her daughter's
betrothed, who was already on his way to the house,
the intelligence of this outrage having quickly spread.
These betrothals take place at an early age, and as
young people, among the Jews, see a great deal of each
other, their marriages, as a rule, are cemented by great
affection, and attended with much happiness. Yusuf
was a young man engaged in trade, who had been in
the habit of travelling with small ventures in the provinces;
he was strongly built, and accustomed to
fatigue, and possessed considerable talent, with a large
amount of caution and common sense. He was almost
in a state of frenzy, which was aggravated by his
knowledge of its impotence, as he listened to Rachel's
description of the occurrence.</p>

<p>"O mother! dear mother! this is horrible, to be
deprived at a blow of all that is dear to me. And oh!
what must her sufferings be? Why are we such
slaves?&mdash;but I will fly to save her! What is my life
worth?" And the spirit of the man made a feeble
attempt to rise within him. "The Sultan shall hear
me, though he slay me!"</p>

<p>"Yusuf, my poor boy," said Rachel, "you can do
nothing: are we not Jews? Your life would be thrown
away, and in vain. What can be done with money,
that I will do; listen to my voice, and if it please the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
God of Abraham to help us, you may yet be the means
of her rescue."</p>

<p>"O mother! but tell me how!"</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;it is now seven years since that an
Arab prisoner fell into the Sultan's power. Through
my husband's assistance (God rest him!), he was enabled
to make his escape; my husband also redeemed
his favourite black horse, which had been given to a
common soldier, and without which he refused to
escape. It was in the cool morning, before the sun
had risen, when my husband guided the Sheik out of
the town gates, where he found his steed ready saddled
for flight. The Arab, free, and once more possessing
his favourite, was moved nearly to tears. My husband
told me that the horse recognised his master, and that
their meeting was like the meeting of two sons of
Adam. The Arab then took my husband by the hand,
and thus addressed him: 'O friend, you have known
me as a helpless prisoner; my faith was not your faith,
yet have you conferred on me benefits which I should
have looked for in vain from these Moors, who call
themselves Moslem. O friend! know me now as
Hamed Ibn Ishem, Chief of the <i>Woled Abou Sebah</i>.
Gold cannot repay the obligations conferred on my
father's son, but gold you shall have. But you are a
Jew, and here, are ever subject to danger and persecution,
and evil days may come, (which God avert!) when
my assistance may be of service to you. Therefore,
you shall take a Pledge of me, that all the tribes may
know that we are brothers, and that the peace of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is between us.' He then took this pouch, embroidered
with his name, from his belt, and put in it a lock of
hair cut from his horse's mane. 'Wherever you show
this, every Arab will obey you. If you are oppressed,
fly with your family to the shadow of my tent:&mdash;if in
danger, send to me for assistance; and as my faith has
not prevented you from aiding me in my distress, I
swear, by the God of Ishmael, that nothing shall prevent
my redeeming this pledge at the risk of my life!
Peace be with you!' and, pressing my husband's hand,
he sprang into the saddle, and was soon lost to sight
in the morning mist. The Sheik sent us gold, but my
husband's beneficent spirit would not allow him to
enrich himself while there were poor to be relieved, and
this pledge was almost forgotten, until to-day it came
on my sight like a messenger from heaven. The
hour of peril <i>is</i> come. Take it, my son&mdash;seek out
the Sheik&mdash;he will redeem his pledge; many of our
people live in their tents, and peradventure I and my
child may escape to the wilderness, even as wandering
birds cast out of the nest. Oh, let not to-morrow's
sun see thee within ten hours' journey of this accursed
city."</p>

<p>Yusuf had listened to this narrative with the deepest
interest, but his mind did not jump so readily at
the conclusion of the sanguine Rachel.</p>

<p>"This is sudden," he said, "and should I find the
Sheik, he may deny his pledge after so long a time."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" interrupted Rachel; "an Arab will
not refuse aid to an ordinary claimant, who seeks hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in his tent. How can a Chief deny his pledge?
If it were possible, he would be shamed and outcast
from his tribe! But he will not!"</p>

<p>"I hope your confidence is well founded, but if
anything happened to Azora before my return? O
mother, I must see her first."</p>

<p>"No, my son," said Rachel, solemnly, "no!&mdash;not
as you value her life. But delay not, every hour&mdash;nay,
every minute is precious."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I obey you; but <i>you</i> must see
Azora, and tell her of my ceaseless devotion; and oh,
entreat her not to be rash, but to gain time as long as
possible. Pray for me on this perilous journey, and
bless me, O my mother."</p>

<p>"God bless thee, my son, even the God of Israel
bless thee, and prosper thee in the way, and bring thee
back again in safety."</p>

<p>They embraced each other affectionately; and Yusuf,
putting away the pouch safely in his bosom, returned
to his own house, with a sad heart, to make a few
necessary preparations for his sudden journey. These
completed, he left word that he should be absent for
some days on a trading expedition, and, mounting his
mule, in less than an hour was wending his way
through the suburbs of the town, absorbed in grief,
but urged on by dread lest the fate of his betrothed
should be decided before his return.</p>

<p>It was the day appointed for a grand hunt, and
the Sultan was passing the time in an octagonal
pavilion in the garden of the palace, until everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was ready to set out. Mulai Abd Er Rahman was about
forty years of age, of a swarthy complexion, with regular
features, and a handsome black beard and moustache;
his eye was of that mild expression which can
blaze out with terrific energy when excited by passion;
his forehead was broad, and surmounted by a turban
of fine muslin. The rest of his dress was not distinguishable
from that of other Moors of rank, and
over all he wore the fine Filelly hayk, which fell in
graceful drapery to his feet.</p>

<p>He was now reclining on a Persian carpet, one arm
leaning on a pile of cushions, fringed and tasselled,
while the other hand held a small china tea-cup and
saucer; drinking green tea being the one occupation
with which the Moors fill up all their spare time, no
milk is used with this tea, but the loaf-sugar is always
put into the tea-pot. On the carpet was a polished
brass tea-tray, with an English service of green and
gold, and some plates of preserves.</p>

<p>The dome of the pavilion, supported on pointed
arches, was brilliantly painted in every variety of
arabesque, and the arches and cornices worked with
stuccoed mouldings, the floor was of lozenge-shaped
glazed tiles of various colours, and these lined the walls
to the height of several feet from the ground. The
doorway was shaded with grape-vines and jessamine on
trellises.</p>

<p>One of the Sultan's attendants now entered, and
with a deep obeisance announced that the Cadi El Faki
Al Maimon had something of importance to communicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
if he might be allowed admission; and the Sultan,
although vexed at the unseasonable intrusion, gave his
permission, with the usual "Bismillah," and the Cadi
appeared. He was motioned to a seat at the lower end
of the carpet; he then proceeded to lay the case of the
Jewess before the Sultan, with sundry invocations of
God's favour on the Khalifa of the Prophet and protector
of the faith; and added that the infidel had
denied the facts, and appealed to his exalted footstool;
and that such being the case, she was now removed
from his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Sultan was not naturally blood-thirsty, but
could be cruel when governed by revenge or cupidity;
and after hearing the Cadi's statement it occurred to
him, that it would save him trouble if he allowed the
Jewess, whom he plainly saw had been falsely accused,
to return to her own persuasion if it could be done
without contravening the law.</p>

<p>"God is great! You say the woman denies the
charge; (enlighten thy servant, O Mohammed!) Is
it not written of the infidel, that he shall voluntarily
repeat his confession before the Cadi and the Ameers
to make the ceremony legal?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful! Our lord the prince can teach
the law to us his slaves; but is it right to allow
indulgence to the infidels, to the injury of the
faith?"</p>

<p>"I will take care of the interests of religion, the
cause is now before me, you are no longer responsible.
Where is the infidel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"She must be arrived by this time," said the Cadi;
"but if I might presume to advise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, priest," said the Sultan, with a movement
of impatience, and a look that Al Maimon did
not think it safe to brave. "You are dismissed from
attendance."</p>

<p>"May blessings be increased on our Lord the
Sultan," he answered, and left the presence, as Azora
was introduced between two soldiers.</p>

<p>When a Jew, of whatever rank, is introduced to the
Sultan, though it be to bring him presents, he is always
brought in by two guards grasping his collar, and
thrown down on his face, then dragged up again and
held, as though he were a criminal. But guided by a
natural feeling of respect for a woman, Azora was
merely left standing on the carpet, and the attendants
retired. She could not forbear trembling before one
whose word was fate, and on an occasion of less importance
would hardly have been able to bear up
against her emotions; but she felt she was a champion
of her faith, and collected all her courage for the emergency.
The Sultan had taken up a letter, which he
was listlessly reading, and by a sign gave her permission
to speak.</p>

<p>"May the king live for ever!" she said. "I have
been falsely accused by perjured men of forsaking the
faith of my fathers. I have appealed to your exalted
tribunal, and I now ask for justice in the name of
God!"</p>

<p>At the first sweet sounds of that soft voice, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Sultan had raised his eyes, and remained gazing at the
beautiful vision that stood before him. The flowing
veil which had concealed her person had fallen, hanging
in loose folds from her left shoulder; and as she proceeded,
her large dark eyes were fixed on the arbiter
of her cause, her finely modelled hand and arm were
raised in invocation of the Deity, and then dropped
slowly to her side. It was enough, her fate was irrevocably
sealed. And a slight hint from his own evil
nature had gone further in proving the soundness of
the Cadi's advice, than if he had supported it by all
the texts in the Koran. Invested with the most arbitrary
power, and unaccustomed to any opposition in
such cases, he stood on little ceremony, when his only
feeling was, that he was conferring a favour. Rising,
he approached her, with an air of gracious familiarity.</p>

<p>"Think you," said he, taking her hand, "that I
can be such a traitor to our Prophet's cause as to
allow such beauty to shine on infidels. Still I have
the power to send you back free&mdash;and make your accusers'
heads roll at your feet. It depends on you,"
he continued, drawing her towards him. "Give the
command, which shall seal the death of your enemies&mdash;your
own triumph&mdash;and my happiness!"</p>

<p>"Mock me not, my lord," said Azora, extricating
herself from his hold, as she perceived his meaning.
"I am unworthy of my lord's notice. I ask not the
death of mine enemies. I ask not my life at the price
of degraded innocence. I ask but justice! And oh!
for the sake of that just God, whom you profess to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
adore, and who will bless the protector of the oppressed,
oh, restore me to my poor mother! Save
me! oh, save me!" and she buried her face in her
veil, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The Sultan's first impression was astonishment at
meeting with such a rebuff, and then his dignity was
offended by the boldness of her speech, but his anger
was checked by her grief, which even he could not
behold unmoved; he attributed it, however, to a
womanish fear of death; but was quite incredulous as
to her resolution holding out so far as to brave it. He
thought it better to give her time for reflection, and
throwing himself on the cushions, said mildly, "Your
fate is in your own hands. Think on your danger,
for <i>I alone</i> can save you." And summoning his attendants,
he directed them to conduct her to the
hareem in the palace. Azora, her eyes streaming with
tears, hopelessly followed her guide to the women's
apartments, where we must leave her to gather strength
for the new trials which she foresaw awaited her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>THE HUNT.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/003.png" width="70" height="70" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">he</span> description of a Moorish hunting party,
though not altogether relevant to my tale,
may interest my sporting readers, and will
contribute to the picture of Maroqueen customs, which
this book, in subordination to the tale, is intended to
illustrate.</p>

<p>"Is all ready?" said the Sultan, to his master of
the horse.</p>

<p>"May my lord's saddle be exalted," said Kaled
Ibn Othman, "all is ready, and your steed is waiting
proudly for the honour of carrying the sacred person
of the Prophet's Khalifa. May my lord's sport be
prosperous!"</p>

<p>"Ameen," echoed the attendants.</p>

<p>Having put on a pair of orange-leather boots, and
received his burnoose and sword from his chamberlain,
the Sultan mounted his horse, a milk-white barb, richly
caparisoned with crimson silk and damask, embroidered
in gold; the broad stirrups, bit, and dagger-like spurs,
plated with gold; the tasselled collar round the neck,
containing charms against the evil eye. Two other
horses were led by grooms, one a superb mottled grey,
with green silk housings; the other a noble black,
with white silk housings. The "shade-bearer" carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a large crimson velvet parasol, the badge of sovereignty,
mounted on a twelve-foot staff, over the Sultan's head,
and his guns, inlaid with gold, silver, and ivory, were
carried by attendants on foot. All the troops that
could be got together were drawn up in irregular lines
on each side of the road, with yellow, red, and green
standards flying; and as the Sultan rode out of the
gate, a deafening shout of "Allaw berk Ommr Seedee!"
(Long life to our lord!) ran along the line until lost in
the distance. After leaving the town, there was little
regularity attended to in the march. A body of
chosen horsemen went first in every picturesque variety
of colour and costume according to the taste or means
of the individual; some had red trappings, some green;
there were swords, and silver-mounted guns, and
ataghans, of different lengths and shapes, caftans of
red, blue, and green, yellow boots or slippers, then
stirrups, bits, and spurs, some gilt, some plated, and
some polished steel; and burnooses white or blue. The
only mark of uniformity being the pointed red fez,
with blue tassel. The chief falconer followed on horseback,
with his men on foot carrying cages on which
perched several pairs of Barbary falcons hooded; one
favourite he carried on his wrist. After these came
huntsmen, leading a number of large fawn-coloured
greyhounds with black muzzles, followed by a motley
crowd of Moors on foot, armed with guns and sticks,
and a pack of dogs, mongrel and hound, for beating
up the country.</p>

<p>Once on the plain, the usual mad riding began;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
parties of ten, fifteen, or twenty horsemen charging at
full speed, and on reaching the Sultan, firing their
guns at his feet, and wheeling off to the right and left,
while others came up in successive charges. This complimentary
custom is never omitted. The Moors are
enthusiastically fond of this "powder play," as they
call it, the Sultan himself often joining in it. On
such occasions he takes the centre of the line, and is
always allowed to be a neck ahead of the rest. They
were obliged to desist from this amusement before
reaching the hunting ground; and after passing through
tracts of olive-plantations, they came to a plain studded
with clumps of trees, brushwood, and a few date-palms
stretching away to the foot of the mountains, and
where the battue commenced; the men forming a
long line beating the jungle. The red partridge rose
in coveys at every point, and were knocked down by the
sticks of the beaters with great dexterity. As the hares
broke, the hounds were slipped, and were scouring the
plain in all directions; there was no such thing as
regularity or fair play, for whenever the hares came
near the beaters they were shot, or disabled by a well-aimed
stick. In another direction, in which the Sultan
rode, the falconers had come upon packs of sand-grouse,
a handsome game bird, as large as the red
grouse, with a very powerful flight. The Barbary
falcon is a splendid bird, a little smaller than the Peregrine,
but of great power and speed. They are not
trained to "wait on," but as they were cast off, they
took the air, and darted like lightning into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
affrighted flock, each time bringing a victim fluttering
to the earth. Altogether it was an animated scene,
dogs yelping, huntsmen hallooing, falconers whooping,
and horsemen galloping over the plain.</p>

<p>A country Berebber having reported a herd of
antelopes feeding three miles off, a halt was ordered
under a clump of trees, to consult on the best mode of
approaching them, and for a short rest. Presently an
altercation among the dismounted horsemen and others
on foot attracted the Sultan's attention, the cause of
which we will relate. They had fallen in with a wandering
Marabt, in a striped cowled frock, studiously
patched, to give it the appearance of raggedness and
poverty; he carried a water pitcher over his shoulder
by a stick, a welcome sight to the huntsmen, who had
been exposed for the greater part of the day to a
burning sun.</p>

<p>"God be praised," said Bozaffer, "who has sent
us water so opportunely.&mdash;Peace," said he to the
Marabt, "and excuse my begging your blessing, till I
have blessed myself with a drink from your pitcher."
And seizing it without ceremony, he took a long
draught, then wiping his mouth, and taking breath, he
continued, "When a man thirsts he is not particular,
but I think the last well you drew from was well stored
with frogs, for I swear a croaker kicked me on the nose
when drinking."</p>

<p>The Marabt's sallow countenance became pale as he
seized his jar, which seemed likely to make the round of
the mouths present. "The blessing of Si Hamet o Moosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be with you, my children! Have I not a hot journey
before me, and shall I not want water to sustain me?
The land is dry and parched!" and he prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Not so fast," said Abd el Aziz, catching the
handle of the water vessel; "you are a Moslim, and
cannot refuse water to Moslmeen who thirst; besides, is
not the river within an hour's walk?"</p>

<p>The Marabt, however, seemed to have other reasons
for refusing their request; but what could sanctity
avail against a dozen men parched with thirst? They
crowded round him, struggling to obtain possession of
the jar, of which he would not loose his hold, and in
the scuffle the fragile vessel was broken to pieces, and
the coveted water was spilt on the arid soil. Bozaffer,
who, having quenched his own thirst, had looked on
encouraging his companions, now sprang forward,
crying, "The frog! the frog!" and picked up a piece
of reed, stopped at each end with beeswax, from among
the fragments.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" he exclaimed, as he opened one end,
and drew forth a written scroll, which had thus been
preserved uninjured in the water.</p>

<p>"Mashallah!" said the Marabt, in as calm a tone
as his agitation would permit. "It is a charm to preserve
me from the evil eye and the dangers of the
road;" and he eagerly extended his hand to take the
paper; but Abd el Aziz, who had marked his look of
terror at the discovery of the scroll, and was enraged at
seeing the water all lost, interposed.</p>

<p>"No, no! A curse on his father! He had good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
reason for refusing water to the Moslim; he is no
Marabt,&mdash;he is a spy!"</p>

<p>Here the approach of Kaled put an end to the
dispute. Abd el Aziz gave him the paper, with an
explanation of the circumstances, and he, returning,
communicated the same to the Sultan, to whom he
presented the paper, holding it with the skirt of his
burnoose. The Sultan, too much occupied with his
sport to examine it at the time, thrust it into his sash,
and ordered the Marabt under a guard to the tents.
And the whole party of horsemen rode off in the direction
of the antelopes; leaving those on foot, and the
rabble to await their return. On nearing the ground
the horses were concealed, and the Sultan and some
good marksmen were placed in ambush among some
brushwood and young date-trees, at a spot they knew
the gazelles must pass to reach the open plains.
Kaled and the horsemen then galloped off, and after
a long d&eacute;tour, surrounded them by a line of men posted
through the wood, which skirted the small plain on the
opposite side, these were ordered to rush out on the
first shot, and turn the game towards the ambush.
Kaled and two of his men were conducted by the guide
for about half a mile, creeping through the bushes;
they then turned into a deep ravine, many of which,
formed by the rains, intersect the plains. Before
leaving the trees they had sighted the herd, about
thirty-five, quietly grazing at a distance of half a mile.
The Berebber scanned the course of the ravine, and
marked every shrub and tuft of grass on its borders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and his quick eye mechanically took in the bearings of
some of the prominent trees among which they stood,
he then directed them to follow in silence. After
creeping cautiously through the ravine, sometimes
making their way through the brambles, sometimes
cutting their naked feet among rocks, or helping each
other over holes and chasms, the gully began to shallow;
presently the Berebber stopped, he then whispered
Kaled, "You see that bush of Nebek in front, with
three thistle-heads growing through it? No? Now
look along this gun."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," whispered the other.</p>

<p>"Inshallah! that is within one hundred and fifty
yards of the herd, you must creep up the bank on your
hands and knees; they will see you instantly, fire at
once, and may you be prosperous."</p>

<p>On reaching the spot the Moors raised their guns
on to the plain, protected by the tufts of grass, before
showing their heads to take aim; as soon as they did so
they caught the eye of the old buck, who with head
erect gazed for a second, and then uttering a loud
grunt, the whole herd bounded across the plain; but
not before the men had fired, two of them missed, the
third was more successful. The old gazelle who brought
up the rear of the herd stopped short as if stunned,
then turned to charge the Berebber, who was running
up to despatch him; but his legs were failing, the blood
gushed from his mouth and nostrils, and he rolled over
on the ground. The horsemen now came galloping
out of the woods, but the herd had already taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
direction of the ambush, and were now out of sight. The
Sultan and his party were losing patience at the long
delay, when the shots were heard, and now, breathless
with excitement, and with guns protruding from stump
and foliage, the echoes had scarcely passed away, when
the herd came sweeping down the glade, with heads
thrown back, and their black shining horns and white
sides and throats glancing in the sun; a moment they
halted, as apprehensive of danger, before nearing the
ambush, but the distant shouts made them again dash
forward, the dead silence only broken by their pattering
feet. Onward they came, till the beautiful creature in
front of the herd was within fifty yards of the Sultan's
stand, when he fired, and the animal springing six or
seven feet into the air, fell dead on his back. A volley
from the rest of the party sent the alarmed herd flying
with increased speed, leaving five more maimed and
struggling on the plain. These had their throats cut,
with the usual formula, "Bismillah!" Without this
they are not lawful; even birds must go through the
same process, and should they be already dead, and
no blood will flow, they are thrown away as unfit for
food.</p>

<p>After sufficient adulation had been bestowed on the
Sultan's skill, they returned to where they had left the
foot-men, and the whole party took the road to the
rendezvous. The gazelles and hares were slung on
mules, and the partridges and grouse carried by the
men on foot. After passing the plain, they came to a
precipitous descent down to the Valley of the Tensift;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the slopes were clothed with the dark evergreen foliage
of the Argan, studded with trees of Sifsaf, whose leaves
appear of glittering silver; with a palm here and
there shooting into the sky. The banks of the river
were brilliant with wild flowers, and clumps of rose-laurel
(Oleander) were reflected in its waters. At a
distance down the valley was seen the white-domed
sanctuary of Sidi Bou Shaib, and near it, on a mound
under a spreading fig-tree, were the white tents,
pitched in a grove. The cavalcade wound slowly
down the steep path, satiated with sport, but were
tempted to cast off their hawks in pursuit of the ducks
and widgeons that rose in flocks from the islets and
pools. The instinct of water-fowl is very remarkable.
Directly the duck sees the falcon swoop, he shuts his
wings, and drops like a stone into the water, followed
by the hawk, who is only driven from the pursuit by
the splashing water. One falcon showed great sagacity&mdash;having
been twice baffled by this ruse, he took
his station on a crag bordering the stream, until another
flight came swiftly down. Motionless, he let
them pass, and then, dropping from his position, shot
along the ground in their track, and overtaking them,
darted upwards, turned on his back, struck his talons
into the breast of his victim, and bore it off in triumph.
Arrived at the camp, the Sultan retired to his tent,
and the whole party, as the evening advanced, spread
their carpets under the shade of the trees. The
soldiers collected in groups, to drink and smoke and
enjoy themselves after the fatigues of the day. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
true the Koran forbids wine and spirits, but there is
not a Moor, from the Sultan downwards, who does not
indulge in them whenever they can procure them.
Mandolines and other instruments were produced, and
Arabian Nights' tales were recited; Arab ballads were
sung and listened to with excited interest by the several
parties.</p>

<p>"Ya Mohammed!" said Muktar, a Moorish soldier,
"that old darweesh Achmed is always dinning us with
his Merjana and the Forty Thieves, and Kalifa the
fisherman, which we and our fathers have been hearing
since the days of Haroun Er Raschid (on whom peace).
Now let us have a song. Sing, O Cassim, son of the
Arab, sing a song of the tent. Had you as many fleas
in your tents as we have in the fondak? if so, you
were wise to leave them."</p>

<p>Cassim was an Arab from the south, who had settled
in the province for some years, and had entered
the Sultan's service as a soldier, not without lingering
regrets for the scenes of his early home. Removing
the pipe from his mouth, he took up the instrument&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will sing, O Muktar, what you cannot understand;
but you will&mdash;the noise."</p>

<p>He then struck the cords, and broke forth into a
song, evidently improvised for the occasion&mdash;a talent
which is not uncommon among this people.</p>

laid down the mandoline, "when shall I again see your
bright sands?"</p>

<p>"Adjaib, oh, wonderful," said Muktar; "if your
country was such a land as this, with wine and oil,
fruits and flowers, and running water, you might love
it; but a barren desert!"</p>

<p>"The desert is for the free!" re-echoed Cassim,
with a contemptuous smile. "What is your country,
with all its beauties? The home of slaves! The peasant
sows, but who reaps? yet even he loves his country.
The Arab's fare of milk and meal, and dates,

from all weathers, and contains those who are dear to
him. Accustomed to gallop in freedom over trackless
wastes, even the air he breathes in other lands oppresses
him, and is too close and confined for his expansive
feelings. The desert for the Arab, the town for the
drudge. God is great!"</p>

<p>"Hear him, O Moslim," said Muktar; "he speaks
like a priest, but give me the rebeb; here goes, for a

they were soon all mounted, and accompanying

<small>THE SPY.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/003.png" width="70" height="70" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">he</span> Sultan being sufficiently recovered from
his fatigue, was reclining in his half-open
tent, when it occurred to him to examine the
paper which had been taken from the Marabt. He
opened and began reading it carelessly, but before he
had finished, his face was livid, for it proved that treachery
was at work among his own personal attendants.</p>

<p>"God is great!" he ejaculated, "God is my protection.
A conspiracy! The address&mdash;Abdslem Ibn
Hadj,&mdash;the slave! And the seal, Sheik Hamed of the
Lion Tribes!" then raising his voice, "Who waits?"</p>

<p>"My lord's slave," answered Abd el Aziz, who was
on guard, and coming forward.</p>

<p>"The spy that was taken this morning, let him be
taken outside the camp and return to me with his
head!&mdash;Go!" said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"On my head and eyes;" and Abd el Aziz receiving
a token from the Sultan, went out immediately to
obey his orders.</p>

<p>The guards whom he summoned, astonished and
awed by the sudden command, mechanically obeyed,
and in spite of his prayers and entreaties the Marabt
was forthwith decapitated, and his head, still dripping
with blood, carried by the lock of hair on his crown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and laid by Abd el Aziz in view of the Sultan, saying,
"Behold the traitor's head! thus perish the enemies of
the Khalifa!"</p>

<p>"God be praised," said the Sultan, counting his
beads. "It is well; so far. Approach and mark&mdash;Take
that head, mount your horse and ride to the
town; cause it to be nailed up over the gate of the
Kasba, and let it be proclaimed that he was a traitor
and a spy of your lord's enemies. That done, seize our
slave Abdslem of the guard, and lodge him in a dungeon,
in chains, with hand torture. Here is my signet,
have I not trusted thee? and thy fidelity shall be
rewarded."</p>

<p>Abd el Aziz prostrated himself, kissed the seal
and placed it in his vest. "My lord's slave is too
highly honoured, in being the bearer of the least of
my lord's commands. May I ever deserve my lord's
favour!" He then left the tent, mounted his horse,
with the bloody head dangling at his saddle-bow, and
with heart elate, galloped to the town, entertaining
himself with visions of the promotion and honours he
was to derive from the Sultan's favour, of which, however,
that head might have taught him the uncertainty.</p>

<p>Rachel, although she had despatched her intended
son-in-law on his mission, left no means untried in the
interval to save her child. She first went round to all
the most influential persons of her own persuasion,
imploring their assistance and begging them to petition
the Sultan for her daughter's liberty. The Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on occasions of this kind when the integrity of their
faith is menaced, always hold together for mutual protection,
and are not sparing of money or exertion to
prevent such precedents being established. The present
outrage had caused a great sensation, and a large sum
of money was at once collected with which to present
themselves before the Sultan, and intercede for the
liberation of Azora. Under any other circumstances,
this would have succeeded, even had there been any
truth in the accusation; but as the case now stood, it
ultimately proved abortive.</p>

<p>The poor mother now repented the rashness of her
language towards Abdslem; and the reason that worthy
did not notice it was, that he foresaw she would be
driven to the necessity of purchasing his friendship, or
buying him off; he also meditated extorting money
from the Jews for the same purpose, and his avarice
had chiefly prompted him to make use of Hassan's
passion to induce him to become Azora's accuser.
Rachel, prepared to submit to any humiliation which
would help to save her child, took her way in the
afternoon through a retired part of the town to
Abdslem's lodging. He was sitting in a small white-washed
room on a smaller carpet, the only furniture
was a mattress on the floor, and a copper ewer and
basin; his gun, saddle, and sword, occupied a corner.
Smoking his pipe of hashish he was ruminating on the
golden harvest he should reap, from the traitorous
connexion he had established with certain Sheiks of
the Arab tribes, when Rachel entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome to the daughter of the infidel!" said he,
with an inquisitive look, as she gathered up her hayk
and sat down at the threshold. "She has repented of
her curses. She might have been punished, but Abdslem
is soft-hearted; what of Azora?"</p>

<p>"'Tis that which has brought me to my lord's
presence," said Rachel. "When I uttered evil words
against my lord, I spoke with the mouth of fools, but
my lord is kind and has forgiven it."</p>

<p>"God is merciful; that is past, my heart has been
heavy for the evil that has befallen your daughter.
Why should I injure her? is she not a houri? That
renegade Hassan was the cause, that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lord admits she was not guilty," said Rachel,
catching at the hint thus intentionally thrown out.</p>

<p>"God is great!&mdash;not exactly&mdash;but if I can help
her, I will do it for the love of God."</p>

<p>"What easier, my lord, than to proclaim her innocence?"</p>

<p>"And so lose my own head! Ah! the infidel's
gratitude. Shall I perjure myself and brave the Sultan?
Is not Azora in his hareem? If I were not so poor, I
have friends at court, whom I might pay for their
interest and intercession. But without money&mdash;Moors
are Jews&mdash;no better."</p>

<p>"You shall have gold," exclaimed Rachel, deceived
by his apparent feeling. "I have some hundred
dollars; do for us what you can, and blessings attend
my lord. When and where shall I find you?"</p>

<p>"An hour after evening prayer, I shall be here,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
said he, scarcely able to conceal his satisfaction. "It
shall be a sacred trust, and may it be the means of
serving your cause."</p>

<p>Rachel's heart was too full for utterance, she kissed
the hem of his dress, and rose to depart, when the
door was thrown rudely open, and Abd el Aziz unceremoniously
entered, without the usual "Peace be
with you!" (It is the height of impropriety for a
Moor to enter another's house uninvited.)</p>

<p>"So, you are Abdslem Ibn Hadj," said he.</p>

<p>"But whose dog's son are you," cried Abdslem,
springing up and laying his hand on his gun, "that
dare to break in on the sanctity of my dwelling?"</p>

<p>"You shall presently repent of your abuse, O son
of a black slave! but now I advise you, to make your
hand and gun more distant relations if you care for
your head; which is likely soon to ornament the Bab
el Kasba, by the side of a friend of yours. Do you
know <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"The Sultan's seal!" exclaimed the astonished
Jewess, while Abdslem started back terror-struck;
his dark cheek blanched and his thick lip quivered
as he saw the near punishment of the crimes of which
his conscience accused him; and when Abd el Aziz,
satisfied with the impression he had produced, ordered
him to follow, he obeyed almost unconsciously. In
the street he was seized by the soldiers who were in
waiting and dragged to prison, and until he should be
finally disposed of the following temporary punishment
was inflicted on him. His hands were filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with quicklime and salt, and then sewn up in raw
hide, which, as it dries, binds the hand like a vice,
while the caustic contents eat into the flesh and cause
the most excruciating pain. He was then heavily
ironed and thrown into a damp dark cell, where we
will leave him to meditate on his misdeeds, while we
accompany Yusuf to the Desert.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THE SAHARA.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/005.png" width="70" height="70" alt="F" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">rom</span> the inquiries he had made, Yusuf learnt
that the Sheik of the Woled Abou Sebah
was encamped on the borders of the Sahara,
between the provinces of Suse and Draha. He had,
consequently, taken a course through the mountains
south of Marocco, where they begin to fall in lower
ranges, towards the sea-coast. The inhabitants of
this country are Berebbers, living in small villages,
among whom he had been in the habit of travelling
on trade; and as they were under the Sultan's government,
there was little danger to be apprehended.
After three days' travelling, almost day and night, he
found himself on the south of the mountains. There
were no more fixed villages. The few inhabitants of
this wilderness, in which vegetation was rapidly disappearing
as he advanced, were living in tents where
wells of water were to be found. Resting at one of
these stations, he had to make up his mind as to his
onward course. The sum of his intelligence was, that
the Sheik's camp was a day and a half journey in the
Desert to the south-east; and that a large caravan
from the north was hourly expected on its way across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Desert to Timbuctoo. His object was to join this
caravan, which he had hoped to have fallen in with
before; and as they usually pay blackmail to the
Arabs, when they are allowed to pass unharmed, he
knew he should thus have no difficulty in obtaining
their guidance to their Sheik.</p>

<p>From these poor peasants he could not obtain a
guide, and he dared not offer them money, which he
knew was a certain inducement for them to strip and
perhaps kill him. His mule, too, was showing signs
of fatigue, from the rapid and unaccustomed journey.
At daylight, after taking the most minute directions
from his host for striking the track of the caravan, he
set off with a stout heart, his mule ambling from four
to five miles an hour; and while the sun was yet far
from noon, he found himself launched on that inland
sea which stretches with little interruption from the
Atlas to the Niger. With some of the instinct of the
Arab, he guided himself by the aid of rising grounds,
sand-hills, and indications left by bleached bones,
sun-dried manure, and some rocks, keeping a straight
course by the sun; but his heart sunk as the afternoon
wore on, and no signs appeared of the desired
tracks. Had the caravan not passed? or had it
passed, and the wind swept the sand over its track
and effaced it? He could travel on, but what probability
of discovering the road, in such a waste? He
might travel another day, and be able to return with
safety, if unsuccessful; but then to lose the object of
his journey, death were better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>He dismounted and sat down to think. The
western sun threw the shadow of his mule far from
him, and despair began to creep over his spirits.
Hark! was that a shout? His heart bounded at a
human voice in such a place, whether of friend or foe;
it was welcome. He sprang up, and scanned the
horizon. Another long, clear call, and at a distance
of three-quarters of a mile he perceived some large
fragments of rock, which he had not before noticed;
on their highest point, and partly relieved against the
sky, stood a dark figure, waving a cloth with one
hand, with what seemed to be a gun in the other. If
there had been danger, there was no escape; but
Yusuf, accustomed to place confidence in these people,
joyfully mounted his mule, and hastened to the spot.</p>

<p>The Desert Arabs, to whom I would now introduce
the reader, are quite a different race from the Moors,
and have little in common with the Arab population of
the Maroqueen provinces. The latter have occupied
these countries, on occasions of depopulation from
plague, have adopted a settled life, and become partially
identified in manners and dress with the people
who surround them. The Arabs of the Sahara retain
their distinguishing characteristics.</p>

<p>Their dress is a blue tunic of India long cloth
confined at the waist by a leather belt; besides swords
and dirks, they carry double-barrelled guns, which
come to them from the French settlements in Senegal.
The complexions of the men are swarthy; their features
are regular and strongly marked; they wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their hair in short curls, and the beard is usually
short. They are decidedly a handsome race, and the
beauty of the women is proverbial in the adjoining
countries, "Dim el Arb" (Arab blood) being a common
expression for female loveliness. They are brunettes,
but their dark eyes and resplendent teeth are
unrivalled. Their living is frugal&mdash;dates, barley-meal,
milk, and cheese: flesh is used sparingly, though
a sheep is always killed when a guest is to be entertained;
the flesh of the gazelle and the ostrich, as
well as that of the camel and sheep, is cut in strips,
and dried in the sun for household supply.</p>

<p>When Yusuf came up, he found four Arabs sitting
under the shadow of the rock, regaling themselves on
dates and barley-cakes, spread on a piece of old garment
on the sand, by the side of which was a small
goat-skin of water. They were on an ostrich-hunt.
Their guns were leaning against the rocks, and their
horses picketed behind them. These horses were what
an Englishman would call "bags of bones;" but they
had magnificent points, were as hard as iron, and had
eyes like lamps.</p>

<p>Yusuf immediately took his place in their circle
with the salutation of "Peace!" This at once enlisted
their good-will.</p>

<p>"Peace: behold the Jew: he hath put trust in
us; he hath no fear."</p>

<p>"The children of the Sahel do not injure their
guests; I have travelled since morning fasting; hunger
will make the fawn brave."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"God's protection is over you," said another.</p>

<p>"Eat!&mdash;behold the food God provides is before
you."</p>

<p>Yusuf looked round at them and at their slender
store of provisions.</p>

<p>"You are four," he said; "your hunting may be
prolonged; before the setting of to-morrow's sun you
may be in more want of it than I. Direct me on my
way; hunger can be borne."</p>

<p>"Art thou not an infidel?" said a third. "Hast
thou no trust in God? Cannot God, who has sent us
to your assistance, likewise provide us with food when
we are in need of it? Eat. O Jew! eat. He who
breaks not bread with the Arab is not the Arab's
friend."</p>

<p>"Bismillah!" said Yusuf, at this conclusive argument,
joining at once in their hard fare. He then
asked, "Has the Soudan Cafila passed, or is it expected?
and am I far from its track?"</p>

<p>"We have just left the track," said the Arab, who
had last spoken; "the Cafila was to reach the last
halting-place"&mdash;here he pointed north&mdash;"last night.
They will rest at mid-day, and should soon be here.
But, O Jew! have you goods in the Cafila? Behold,
we have broken bread together; take your camels
and return, for danger is before you. The Sheik of
the Seba&iuml;e is at war with the Sultan. Lo, you are
warned; our faith is clean."</p>

<p>"Your bread is sacred; hear the truth; I have
no goods nor camels; I go to seek the tents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Sheik himself, and only accompany the Cafila until I
can procure a guide thither."</p>

<p>"If so, you have started in a fortunate hour. I
will direct you; when you come to the second well in
the desert,&mdash;should nothing happen before, for we
know not what is written,&mdash;ask any Arab to guide
you to the Chief, for he is not far thence. Be cautious,
though you have nothing to lose&mdash;you travel
with merchants. Remember the proverb, 'If you put
your head in bran, the fowls will peck it.' Lo! I see
the Cafila approaching."</p>

<p>Yusuf turned his eyes in the direction where the
smooth desert was broken into low sand-hills, among
which the long train was seen slowly winding onwards,
and, although at a great distance, the loaded
camels and their drivers could be seen, magnified by
the evening mirage, like gaunt spectres against the
horizon.</p>

<p>"May you be rewarded, friend," said Yusuf; "I
am warned; but the infidel puts his trust in God."</p>

<p>The Arabs smiled as Yusuf remounted, and with
salutations of Peace, he rode off; and before it was
dark had joined the Cafila.</p>

<p>These caravans are composed of traders, who periodically
assemble to traverse the Desert in company
for mutual protection. They sometimes take guards,
but their chief security is in the tribute they pay to
the Arab tribes through which they pass. They carry
manufactured goods and wares to Soudan and Timbuctoo,
bringing back in exchange ivory, gold-dust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
ostrich feathers, gums, and slaves. They number from
five hundred to a thousand camels. These large
caravans are called <i>Akaba</i>. I use the word Cafila as a
more familiar term, and as applied to a smaller expedition.
The persons composing the present one not
having yet experienced much of the hardship of
Desert travelling, were in great spirits. The camel-drivers
and muleteers were singing and chanting
verses of Arabic songs, improvised or from memory,
which were answered by others more or less wittily,
and drawing shouts of laughter from all within hearing.
The singing encourages the camels to quicken
their pace, and contributes to the gaiety, by the measured
time of their bells.</p>

<p>About twenty horsemen had escorted the Cafila
hitherto, but were to leave them a couple of stages
further, as it is only horses trained to it from colts
that can live on the Desert. Others were discussing
the rumours of war between the Sultan and the Chief
of the Arab tribes, which had excited in them the
greatest alarm.</p>

<p>"By the tomb of Mulai Idris," said a little rotund
fat Moor from Fez, with a florid complexion and long
white beard, which his fingers were continually combing;
and mounted on a tall ambling mule. "By the
tomb of Idris (may his sanctity be increased!) if I
had heard this news before, I would have sacrificed all
the gain on these camel-loads before I would have left
my shop in the Kaisaria, and then, perhaps, to lose our
life also, by the hands of these blood-thirsty Arabs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
who knows what is written, Allaw Kereem?" and the
little man's hands kept time with his increased agitation.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Prophet, uncle Mohammed,"
exclaimed a Marocco horseman, with a long gun across
the pommel of his saddle, "you cry out before you are
hurt. You are rich; I am a beggar; but are we not
strong enough to send a whole tribe of these Arabs
(the curse of Mohammed upon them!) to their fathers'
graves, if they can find them in this sea, where you
may lose sight of a camel for an hour, and not find
him in a month?" And laughing at his own bald
wit, he turned to another horseman, who, from his
northern accent and striped djilabea, the hood of
which was drawn over his head, seemed to be from
the neighbourhood of Tetuan; he was mounted on a
raw-boned horse, like those of the ostrich-hunters, and
was at the time loading his gun.</p>

<p>"What say you, friend? You seem prepared for
work, but I trust there is no cause for fear."</p>

<p>The other looked up sharply at the speaker from under
his hood, and went on with his occupation, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He that despises his enemy is not wise; he that
reviles a people in their own country is not wise; for
sands as well as walls may have ears. I cannot talk,&mdash;when
time serves, I may act. Danger there is, but
as for cause of fear,"&mdash;and he once more looked at
his companion's face, which had waxed paler&mdash;"it
does not seem required in your case."</p>

<p>The horseman, whose name was Mohammed, galled
by the reproof, but not daring to resent it, drove his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
spurs into his horse, which plunged forward and brought
him in contact with the mule's load, a projecting part of
which caught the folds of his dress, causing a large
rent, and exposing a belt he wore next his person.
This did not escape the other's quick eye, though he
appeared to take no notice. The moon was a few days
old, but the light of a clear, starry sky was sufficient on
these white plains, and they travelled on until midnight,
when they arrived at some wells, and halted.
These wells were of a great depth, and the water was
drawn from them in small leathern buckets, and poured
into a stone trough, the exhausted camels biting,
kicking, and pushing, in their eagerness to reach the
coveted fluid. As the camels were watered, their fore
knees were tied up, to prevent them straying, and they
were turned loose to graze, on what few thorny plants
they could find, while the men rolled themselves in
their hayks, and were soon asleep, undisturbed by the
roaring of camels, the shouts of the drivers, and the
confusion which lasted for hours.</p>

<p>At daylight the march was resumed, but the party
seemed to have lost their spirits; the song was hushed,
and nothing was heard but the vociferations of the
drivers, urging on their beasts, while the merchants
plodded on silently, their heads enveloped in burnooses
and large turbans, as a protection against the sun.
About noon they came to a firmer soil, and the guides
gave notice that they were approaching the halting-place,
while the spirits of all were exhilarated by the
prospect of reaching rest and water. Yusuf remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the warning of the Arab, indicating these wells
as the place of danger. About an hour's ride ahead,
they could see masses of rock and brushwood on the
plain, and when about a mile from this, the man on
the spare horse rode forward to borrow a flint to put
in his gun; and, whether by accident or design, it
went off. A movement was now seen among the rocks,
and spears and shining gun-barrels protruding above
them, showed the place to be occupied.</p>

<p>"We are betrayed!" ran from mouth to mouth;
"A signal!" "Down with the Kafir!" and they surrounded
the horseman who had fired the shot. He
remonstrated against their quarrelling amongst themselves,
but was only met with cries of "Down with
him!" "Drag him off his horse!" when, seeing they
were determined on violence, he suddenly stripped off
his striped cloak and turban, hurling them, with the
gun he had fired, far away with his right hand, while
his left held his bridle and a short double gun; his
blue frock showed him to be an Arab.</p>

<p>"Back, slaves!" he shouted, in a voice of thunder;
"I am Ali the Falcon!" and a smile of scorn
was on his face, as the crowd recoiled before him,
"let wisdom be with you. You thought <i>me</i> in <i>your</i>
power&mdash;you are in mine&mdash;resistance is useless, offer
none, and I pledge my word that you shall all return
unharmed in person; the word of Ali el Bezz is
sacred. Resist, or draw blood,&mdash;and may the curse
cleave to my father's tents if every soul of this company
shall not die this day!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd were panic-struck; some knew him,
and all had heard of his daring deeds and wonderful
escapes. The majority, who had not much to lose,
were content to save their skins, but the rich merchants
were loth to lose their all without a struggle,
but were feebly seconded by the soldiers. At this
critical moment, a band of thirty or forty horsemen,
breaking the silence of the Desert with their united
war-cry, "Allaw hu ackba&#257;r!" their guns poised above
their heads, rushed down at full speed, through a
cloud of dust, on the affrighted travellers, while Ali,
overlooked in the confusion, galloped out of the
throng, and joined his band, who, seeing no appearance
of resistance, had come to a halt.</p>

<p>"You should be more cautious," said Ali to his
lieutenant; "not show your teeth before you can bite.
You nearly sent me to heaven across the edge of a
knife."</p>

<p>"It was not a fortunate hour, and you have escaped
the houris! To keep these fellows quiet when plunder
is in view, were to keep fire in a goat-skin. But, by
the Prophet, we may lose our prize yet."</p>

<p>The score of horsemen belonging to the Cafila had
ranged themselves in front, thinking, by a show of
resistance, to intimidate the Arabs, and make terms;
but these, with Ali at their head, immediately dashed
forward, standing erect in their stirrups, ready to pour
in a volley, but the Moors, seeing their determination,
at once turned their horses' heads and fled.</p>

<p>"Shame upon them!" said Ali; "they are soldiers&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
are Moslem&mdash;they abandon their trust without
a blow. Yes! slaves are cowards! Will they not
tremble when Sheik Hamed rides to the gates of Marocco?
Now mark! my word is passed for their safety,
on submission. I have other game afoot." And putting
his horse to speed, he disappeared across the
plain in the direction of the flying horsemen.</p>

<p>The Arabs, meeting with no resistance, dismounted,
and proceeded to secure their plunder, stationing half-a-dozen
pickets to prevent a surprise. The Moors and
camel-drivers were stripped of everything that was of
value, and the camels with merchandise were collected
and made to kneel down by themselves. The Arab
left in command galloped about superintending the
disposal of the spoil, recommending submission and
promising protection.</p>

<p>The old Fez Moor, finding that no one was killed,
consoled himself in his fatalism, ejaculating as he was
stripped,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is written! God is great! It is written!"</p>

<p>Others, seeing the robbers were so forbearing, were
less patient, but for these a hand on the dagger was
an unanswerable argument.</p>

<p>Yusuf had been a patient spectator of the scenes
which had been enacted, but it now came to his turn,
and one of the robbers approached to strip him.</p>

<p>"Friend," said he, "offer me no violence. I am
under the protection of your Sheik Sidi Hamed Ibn
Ishem. My journey is to meet him. In his name,
forbear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Infidel dog!" said the robber, "this trick shall
not save your gold; you would give a drop of blood
for every copper rather than part with it. You know
the reward of resistance;" and he seized the defenceless
Jew.</p>

<p>"Stop," said another, "we may repent, if the infidel
speak truth. Jew," said he to Yusuf, "you
come alone; have you no token?"</p>

<p>"I have," said he, "but it is as my life; take me
to your leader."</p>

<p>They led the way to where the Arab was resting
among the bales, with his bridle in his hand.</p>

<p>"I have claimed the sanctuary of the great Sheik,"
said Yusuf; "it has been refused me. A token has
been demanded of me; lo, there it is."</p>

<p>He took the packet from his vest, and uncovering
the velvet pouch, gave it to the Arab; the
man, seeing the cypher of the Sheik, immediately
kissed it, put it to his forehead, and returned it to
Yusuf.</p>

<p>"It is enough," he said; "he is our brother;
give him the best mule in the Cafila, and whatever he
desires. Behold! he is under the shadow of the tent
of Sidi Hamed."</p>

<p>The news ran from mouth to mouth, and there was
nothing now they were not anxious to do to serve the
Sheik's guest, and his newly-acquired influence was
used to intercede for some of the merchants, when he
saw them too hardly used.</p>

<p>"Hast thou not bitten off thy tongue?" said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
robber to the other who had assaulted Yusuf, "better
for thee, than to have reviled the Sheik's guest&mdash;the
unbeliever has a big heart, make your peace."</p>

<p>"I am in the hands of God, Astofer Allaw," said
the other.</p>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/004.png" width="70" height="70" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">li</span>, who was the Sheik of the douar that had
plundered the Cafila; and had gone in pursuit
of the flying soldiers; soon discovered
Mohammed, all alone, and urging on his fatigued horse,
which had no chance of escape from the enduring animal
ridden by the Arab, whose object was, not to injure
the soldier, but to secure the belt he wore round his
person; so that, when within fifty yards of the chase,
he called out to him to stop at his peril, promising
quarter on submission.</p>

<p>Mohammed, recognising his travelling companion,
and not daring to trust him after what he had said,
checked his labouring horse, and, turning round in his
saddle, levelled his long gun and fired, but with uncertain
aim. The Arab muttered a deep curse as his
horse fell under him, and, springing to his feet before
the Moor could recover his speed, he had fired with a
firm footing. Mohammed reeled in his saddle, his gun
and reins dropped from his weakened grasp, he snatched
at the pommel, and rolled over on the sand. The
horse, missing his rider, stopped short, and stood foam-covered
and panting with fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Ali, seeing his enemy fall, turned to his own horse,
and a short examination showed that he would not rise
again. The ball had struck his shoulder, and glanced
inwards. The Arab sat down opposite his favourite,
and buried his face in his hands; he thought of the
many years he had stood at his tent, and the many
perils from which he had saved him. He might have
another, he might get a better, but it would not be the
same. The wounded animal raised his head, in a weak
effort to take a last look at his master, while large tears
rolled from his bright eyes down his face.</p>

<p>"Poor Gazelle! O my child&mdash;you want but speech.
God is great! It is written!&mdash;we must part!" and
he retired a few paces to witness the end of his favourite.
The expiring horse made a sudden plunge to regain his
feet, but fell back powerless, his bright eye filmed, a
convulsive struggle came over his frame, he groaned
heavily, and died.</p>

<p>"You are avenged," said Ali, as he walked slowly
to where Mohammed was lying; "for you, your doom
was just. God is great!&mdash;his curse has fallen on his
own head; his money has cost him his life,&mdash;and never
will <i>his</i> children find their father's grave."</p>

<p>He unfastened the belt which the Moor wore under
his clothes, and he found it was padded with doubloons
and bintekee; he also stripped him of the principal
part of his clothing; burnoose, caftan, and turban being
of no use to one whose bones would bleach the desert
till the judgment; and throwing the things across the
Moor's jaded horse, he took a last look at his faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
companion, and returned with a heavy heart to rejoin
his band, an additional pang going through him as the
dark shadows of the vultures, descending from the blue
vault, passed and repassed him, sharply defined by the
sunlight on the white plain. The camels had been all
reloaded, ready to start, escorted by the Arab horsemen.
The plundered merchants, with a few sorry animals
which were restored to them, and with sufficient provisions
to serve them on their return, were left to retrace
their steps to Marocco. The night was now setting in,
and the band, accompanied by Yusuf, who was mounted
on the tall mule that had belonged to the little Fez
Moor, struck across the desert, travelling by the light
of the stars, with an occasional rest, till morning; and
as the sun rose, clear and warm, above the level of the
horizon, they came in sight of the head-quarters of the
Arab Chief, situated in a sort of depression of the
ground. This spot was called <i>Ain El Khmmis</i>, from
five wells, which afforded an invaluable supply of water.
Myriads of black goats'-hair tents covered the plain,
pitched in circles, or hollow squares of thirty or sixty
tents, under their different Sheiks. Horses were
picketed before every tent; camels were kneeling in
rows, or straggling in search of stray vegetation, or
browsing on the shoots of the stunted absinth and
thorny shrubs that studded the plain. As the band
approached this city of tents, the Arabs were at their
morning prayers, and the sound of the chant, from
such a multitude of voices, had an imposing effect, as
it rose in the distance. By the time they arrived, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had betaken themselves to their occupations, some
driving their flocks to pasture, some tending their
horses&mdash;few giving more than a passing glance and a
"Salamo Allikoom," to the advancing party. It was
a strange contrast to the scene presented by the encampments
of the Moorish soldiery;&mdash;there, all is confusion,
and nothing heard from morn till night but
music, singing, and revelling, mingled with the constant
discharge of fire-arms. <i>Here</i>, all was order, their
tents being their homes; every one had his occupation,
while in and around the tents the women were employed
grinding corn, spinning wool, weaving hayks in
hand-looms, &amp;c. It is the difference between a tent
as a home, and a tent as an amusement. In the
midst of the camp were pitched the tents of the Chief,
marked by a large green silk banner; they were placed
in two concentric circles, the inner one entirely private.
In the outer circle, one large tent towards the East, and
the only one that opened outwards, was set apart for
audiences, for guests, for meeting the Sheiks on business,
and disposing of disputes and causes among his
people. The dialect of Arabic, spoken in the desert, is
remarkable for its deep guttural intonation; that of
Marocco for its softness.</p>

<p>Sidi Hamed Ibn Ishem was sitting in this large
tent, which was only furnished with a few mat cushions,
but spread with carpets, when Ali and his band arrived.
He wore the same dress as his people, his patriarchal
authority requiring no external mark of distinction.
He was a fine model of masculine beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tall and symmetrically made, but spare, and with feminine-looking
hands and feet. His hair clustered round
his head in short, glossy curls, and his whiskers and
moustache terminated in a short, wavy beard. His
features were aquiline; his head not large, but would
have served as a model for an &AElig;neas. His countenance
and eye showed firmness and severity tempered by
benevolence and generosity, which commanded confidence
and inspired sympathy. He was surrounded
by the principal Sheiks, when Ali halted his men, and
went in to make his report. The Sheik rose, and their
salutation was as of two friends and equals, kissing
each other's hands and heads.</p>

<p>"Welcome, O Sheik! Is all well?"</p>

<p>"God has blessed us, Ya Sidi; all is well!"</p>

<p>"Praise be to Him! Why does the Sheik ride
another horse? Where is Gazelle? You would not
part with him alive?"</p>

<p>"My lord has said:&mdash;he lies low on the Sahel.
The vulture and hyena are feasting on my beautiful,
he fell not unavenged, the hand that smote him lies
cold by his side on the plain: God's will be done!
Must not death come to all?"</p>

<p>"My heart is straitened for your loss: is it not
that of a friend? It was written, O Sheik! But
what&mdash;are there not horses in our tents? We will
find you another."</p>

<p>"May God enlarge my lord's tent, who soothes the
wounds of his servants as with the balm of Mecca.
This makes me not feel my loss."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are we not friends? Are we not brothers, children
of Ishmael? What is mine is my brother's."</p>

<p>The business of the caravan having been disposed
of, Ali informed him that a Jew had been taken travelling
with the Cafila, and was waiting without to be
introduced, he had not been injured, as he held a token
from the Chief, and claimed his protection. Dismissing
his companions, the Chief retired to a private tent,
where Yusuf was conducted to his presence. And the
son of Isaac bowed down and kissed the earth before
the son of Ishmael, the lord of the desert.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, peace; and his blessing
upon my lord, the Sheik, and upon his tents."</p>

<p>"Peace, O my friend!" said the Sheik, in a tone
of encouragement. "Speak; you are fasting and
fatigued. Speak&mdash;are we not alone?"</p>

<p>"The journey I have travelled to see my lord's
face has been long, but it did not make me faint; thy
servant is crushed with the sorrow that has preyed on
his heart. Does my lord remember his servant Rabbi
Shallum?"</p>

<p>"Can I forget him? God has taken him. Behold
that horse," pointing to a noble black charger,
picketed in front of the tent. "Did he not ransom
his sire? and did he not aid me to escape from the
hands of my enemies? and shall I not remember him?
Has any evil befallen his house?"</p>

<p>"Alas! my lord, that is my errand: and that I
speak truth, behold the token my lord gave into his
hands. The hour of need is come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>And he presented the pouch, which the Sheik immediately
recognised. Yusuf then related the history
of Azora's arrest and danger, and that he had since
heard that she had been removed to the Sultan's
hareem. "And now, O my lord," he said, "if you will
assist the child of your friend, her peril is pressing,
and delay is death."</p>

<p>"Have I not given a pledge? and shall it not be
redeemed? If it is in the power of my hand, she
shall not perish, if it please God. This shall be attended
to before all. Go now and refresh thyself. We
will speak on this matter."</p>

<p>Yusuf hesitated in doubt. "O my lord, forgive
my speech. God be praised for your promise of help.
But doubts arise in my mind. We are Jews&mdash;we are
despised, my lord is of a high race, and of a great
heart; but will his servants among the tribes approve
of his assisting us; and may not policy compel my
lord to disappoint our hopes? Let not my words
offend."</p>

<p>"You are forgiven: for thus do the people of the
city act. But know that an Arab's Pledge is irrevocable.
Who," said he, rising, while his face beamed
with generous feeling, "who was it that rescued me
and returned my father's son to his tents?&mdash;A Hebrew!
Who restored the chief to his people?&mdash;A Hebrew!
Who ransomed thy sire, my noble steed, from the
galling yoke of an hireling?&mdash;A Hebrew! And who
saved me from death, and from loss of liberty worse
than death, and gave me once more to see the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
tents of my tribe, and to feel my heart again expand in
the freedom of my dear native plains? All this weight
of benefit was conferred on me by a Hebrew! Did he
allow me to perish because I was of another faith?
Did he forsake me in peril because I was a Moslem?
No! We had this faith in common,&mdash;God is the God
of nations. Let every man cleave to his own form that
he has received from his fathers; but do good to all,
like God's rain; and never abandon a son of Adam in
distress, because he worships his God in a different
manner from himself. And shall the Arab be shamed
by the Hebrew? Shall Hamed Ibn Ishem remain in
quiet enjoyment of all that the Hebrew's hand has restored,
whilst his child lies in peril, and not arise to
save her? Go, my friend, our tents are yours. Think
better of the son of Ishem, and believe that he never
gave a pledge, which, with the help of God, he will
not, at whatever peril, to the uttermost redeem."</p>

<p>Yusuf, though his habits and pursuits had given
him a practical turn of mind, could not help gazing
with admiration at the noble form before him, draped
in his falling hayk, his action giving emphasis to his
generous speech; and he thought that such a man
might have been Abraham, when greeting the angels
at the door of his tent.</p>

<p>"May the blessing of the God of our father Abraham
be upon you!" said he; and kissing the Sheik's
hand he retired to the tent allotted to him, to rest after
his long fatigues, and offer up his thanksgiving for the
success of his mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Ali having disposed of the booty of the Cafila,
repaired to his own camp.</p>

<p>"God be praised for your return," said his wife,
who flew to embrace him, "how often are you absent
now, O my lord, and I am left desolate in the tent!"</p>

<p>She was a type of Arab loveliness, was Za&iuml;da; the
bright crimson shone through her tinted, but transparent
cheeks, her hair fell, a waving veil, over her
shoulders, and her large eyes were turned inquiringly
in his face. He returned her embrace, and then releasing
himself from her soft arms, he sat down sorrowfully
on the carpet, and threw down the soldier's belt.</p>

<p>"It is the will of God," he said; "there is gold,
accursed be it, it has cost me my friend&mdash;Gazelle is
dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead!" echoed Za&iuml;da, and the beautiful creature
again threw herself into her husband's arms, and wept
on his bosom; she grieved for his loss, she grieved for
her own; but she grieved more for what he had suffered.
Her grief gave a new turn to his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Be consoled, my darling," he said, caressing her,
and wiping away her tears. "God has given and God
has taken; but have I not you? Have I not many
blessings? Why do I complain? The gold will buy
another horse; but&mdash;it will be another. Where is my
boy? Where is Ishmael?"</p>

<p>"He went out early," she said, "but his return
cannot be delayed: I see him coming even now."</p>

<p>A fine lad of twelve or fourteen now came up,
holding a gun in one hand, and with the other leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a large tawny greyhound, whose sedate physiognomy
contrasted with the bright, joyous face of the young
Arab, as he ran to meet his father. He paused a minute
as he passed the spot where the soldier's horse was
tethered, and then embraced his father.</p>

<p>"My heart is joyful that you have returned in
peace," said he, "but&mdash;" and he turned an inquiring
and pained look towards the place whence he missed
his loved companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," said Ali, "a stranger stands in the
place of your friend, you will see Gazelle no more&mdash;he
fell in a fray by the hand of an enemy."</p>

<p>"Gone for ever!" cried Ishmael: large tears rose to
his eyes, which he could not control, and dashing down
the stock of his gun, with childish wrath: "would that
I had here the base-born that did the deed, even this
tent should not protect him from vengeance!"</p>

<p>"Be silent, boy! you know not what you say. You
are young. But learn that the sanctuary of this tent
should protect even the murderer of thy father! But
here, put away these things," giving him his sword,
gun, and accoutrements.</p>

<p>Ishmael felt the justice of his father's reproof; but
his young mind thought it a great hardship to forego
a just revenge. Having put away the arms in a corner
of the tent, he and his father joined in the meal which
had been waiting, and was now sent out from the inner
tent. By the time they had finished, an Arab was seen
approaching, leading a fine iron-grey horse, completely
equipped, and they went out to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sidi Hamed," said the Arab, "has sent you this
horse to replace the one you have lost, and my lord
desires you to be in readiness to mount in a few hours
for a long journey."</p>

<p>"Tell the Sheik," said Ali, "that I am grateful
for his gift. Is not my life at his service? Say I will
await his orders."</p>

<p>The horse having been consigned to an attendant,
"Go," said he to his son, "and tell your mother what
you have heard&mdash;I cannot!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>THE SULTAN.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/002.png" width="70" height="70" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">n</span> the day succeeding the hunting party, the
Sultan, having taken his place in his audience-hall,
with his secretaries and officials
in attendance, directed Abd el Aziz to have the executioners
in readiness; and then ordered Abdslem to be
brought before him. He was accordingly brought in
heavily ironed, from the prison where he had lain all
night. The pain from the treatment his hands had
undergone was becoming excruciating; but he forced
his features to assume an expression of composure;
which was undisturbed by the preparations he saw
making by the executioner as he passed; and on which
he depended for his success in escaping from punishment.
As soon as he had been forced to bow down
before the Sultan, and was allowed to stand, and before
waiting for the usual permission to speak: "May our
lord's life be prolonged. Is this," said he, lifting up
his tortured hands in chains, "is this the reward of
loyalty? Shall the breath of private slander deprive
my lord of his most devoted slaves? Where are my
accusers? What is my crime?" and he looked boldly
round on the audience.</p>

<p>The Sultan being in possession of such glaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
evidence of his guilt, was somewhat astonished at his
assurance. "What mockery is this?" said he. "Is the
slave mad? Read out this letter, that he and all may
know that he dies with justice."</p>

<p>The Taleb, to whom the letter had been handed,
opened the scroll, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the name of the One God, the Merciful, peace
and his blessing. To our friend Sidi Abdslem Ibn el
Hadj, Marockshee. We have received and considered
the words that you have sent us, requiring money to
seduce the soldiers of your master the Sultan; time
shall not be prolonged before you will be met by a
faithful messenger: exert yourself, be faithful, and be
assured of our friendship. Peace. This &mdash;&mdash; day of Moharram,
1248." Attached was the seal of the Sheik of
the Seba&iuml;e.</p>

<p>A thrill ran through the assembly, as they listened
to the perusal of this flagrant proof of guilt, and felt
that his days were numbered. The Sultan had watched
the prisoner's countenance, which did not appear to be
disturbed by any conviction of guilt, but rather assumed
an air of greater self-complacency.</p>

<p>"And is that, my lord," said he, "the crime that is
laid to your slave's charge? Alas! for the dream of
the seller of earthenware! On that letter I had built
a vision of rewards and honours from the Khalifa, and
behold what has befallen me! Let my lord slay me, if
so it is written; but let my lord hear me alone&mdash;and
your servant's innocence will be white, and my lord will
hear matters of importance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sultan was staggered; Abdslem had maintained
his part with such coolness and confidence that the
Sultan's curiosity was excited, though he never supposed
he could explain away such convincing evidence.
Fettered as he was he was harmless; and on a motion
from the Sultan, the secretaries, officials, all, withdrew
out of hearing, to the lower end of the hall, and Abdslem,
kneeling at the border of the Sultan's carpet, on
a motion to speak, proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May my lord live for ever! It is now two months
ago, that ever watchful to frustrate the designs of my
lord's enemies, I noticed a trader, a man of suspicion,
mixing with the soldiers; determined to know his object,
I put myself in his way, and drew him into talk. I
will not repeat his blasphemy against your highness,
exalted of God; but pretending to be deceived, I lured
him on, until he had the audacity to propose to me, on
the part of an Arab Sheik, to corrupt my lord's servants
from their allegiance, promising me rewards. I was
immediately inspired with the design of entrapping the
rebel Sheik, and placing him in my lord's power. I
wrote a letter, to which that now read is an answer, and
to ensure his coming, I asked for money, which he
would either bring himself, or come with promises instead,
for Arabs like not to part with their gold. The
miscarriage of his letter has frustrated my plan, and,
but for my lord's forbearance, must ere this have cost
me my life. As it is, I have suffered; but it is in my
lord's service. God is great! It was written."</p>

<p>This clever explanation of the affair, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
appeared to be so seriously compromised, had gradually
changed the Sultan's feelings towards him; but he
remained for some minutes with his brows knit, his
beard resting in his hand, and his eyes fixed on the
prisoner's face, as though he would read his heart.
"God is merciful," he said, at length. "This may be
true, the All-knowing knows. Yes: you shall prove
its truth. The Sheik will not know that his letter fell
into our hands,&mdash;his messenger will come,&mdash;you will
bring him before us. Thus shall you prove your truth.
You are free! Guards there!" and half-a-dozen soldiers
rushed in, expecting orders to drag Abdslem to
his fate. "Knock off his fetters, and let his hands be
released; he is free!"</p>

<p>Abdslem prostrated himself and kissed the earth,
he was then led out by the soldiers, invoking blessings
on the Sultan's clemency.</p>

<p>The Wezeer and secretaries now resumed their
seats.</p>

<p>"I have intelligence from Algiers, O my lord,"
said the Wezeer.</p>

<p>"Speak, O Hadjie," said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"There has been a battle near Oujda on our
borders, and the Emir Abd el Kader has beaten the
infidels."</p>

<p>"May the infidels be accursed!" said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"The Ameer has sent a white female slave for the
Sultan's hareem."</p>

<p>"The slave will be welcome," said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"God is great!" said the Wezeer, "but as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
lord can see, the object of the Ameer is to embroil the
Sultan with the French, and compel us to be his
allies."</p>

<p>"Are we Algerines and sons of Othman that we
should fear the infidels?" said the Sultan; "send a
letter of thanks to the Ameer, and a present of steeds
with embroidered trappings."</p>

<p>"My lord's will shall be obeyed," said the Wezeer.
He then continued, "The French are strong in ships,
O Sultan! and Suerah will be attacked by sea, and
where will be my lord's revenues from the merchants?
Moreover, the slave is not young, and has grey eyes,
and red hair: by the side of the houris of Mequinez,
she is an Afreet!"</p>

<p>"Let her be sent back!" exclaimed the Sultan:
"why should we quarrel with the Francese? They
can stop our commerce on the sea. Who is Abd el
Kader that we should fight for him? Is he not a
Berebber of the Kabyles? Send orders, O Wezeer, to
the Ka&iuml;d of Oujda to resist any violation of our
frontier."</p>

<p>"The Khalifa shall be obeyed," said the astute
Wezeer.</p>

<p>He then took up another letter. "Here, O my
lord," he said, "is news that war is about to break
out between the Inglees and the Oroose; may the
Beneficent give us peace."</p>

<p>"O Wezeer," said the Sultan, "what is that to
us? let the infidels fight, what is that to the true
believers? if the dog bite the pig, or the pig bite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dog, what is that to us? Are we not Moslemeen?"
And he arose and broke up the audience.</p>

<p>Azora sat alone in a room in the women's apartments;
it was furnished with carpets, ottomans, and
cushions. At one end, a glass door opened into a
garden, full of fruit-trees and flowers, but surrounded
by high walls. An old woman to whose charge she
had been consigned had selected the room for her, and
treated her with every attention. Here, without altering
her dress, she had snatched an unrefreshing
sleep. She had received a communication from her
mother,&mdash;for gold can open a Sultan's hareem&mdash;enjoining
on her to gain time, by procrastination, to
further the measures taken for her deliverance, and
she naturally shrunk from hurrying on her own fate,
if delay might be obtained without a sacrifice of principle.
Her eyes were fixed on the walls of her prison,
and she was absorbed in deep and painful thought on
her unfortunate position and probable fate, when she
was startled by the entrance of the Sultan. She immediately
arose and stood by the door of the garden,
involuntarily, from fear or humility, removing as far as
possible from him.</p>

<p>"Have you an answer to my proposal, O light
of my earth?" said he, approaching her with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Alas, my lord!" said Azora, clasping her hands,
"is justice dead? is there no condition of freedom
but sinning against God, even the God of my fathers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Talk not to me of gods," said he, impatiently;
"my religion does not interfere with my pleasure; if
it is to save you from danger, do not your priests
teach you that compulsion is not sin? But why, O
my beautiful, talk of sin?" he continued, in a winning
tone. "Is it a crime to love? Can your gentle eyes
spurn a Sultan from your feet? Drive me not to
despair. Oh, if you would but adopt our holy faith,
I, even I, would be your champion; and where would
be the slave that would dare to think a thought to
harm you? Oh, Azora! Azora! I have had no peace
since I saw you; you are the sultana, I am the slave,&mdash;the
victim. Oh, look on me at your feet, and have
pity,&mdash;on yourself, on me!" He was on his knee,
with his left hand he held her right, which was cold
as marble, while the other was stretched out imploringly.
There is no doubt he loved her, as much as
a man so incapable by habit of real love could do.
She was so different from the inmates of his hareem;
many of these doubtless had beauty, but it was the
difference of human beings reared in a torpid state of
seclusion, and one who had been always free!&mdash;the
fascination of intellect. Azora would not have been
woman, had she not been deeply moved by this earnest
appeal. To see him, before whom all men trembled,
a suppliant at her feet, it was a fearful trial for human
nature unaided. And she breathed an inward prayer
for help. She dreaded the storm which she saw
gathering, but felt more courage to brave his threats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
than his entreaties. Gently disengaging herself from
his hands, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my lord, tempt me not. Let not my lord
kneel to his servant; threaten me, torture me, but
let not my lord talk of love. Do I not know the
fate of a favourite,&mdash;the plaything of a day; thrown
by to pine in neglect and solitude? And shall I not
expect, and deserve, worse than these,&mdash;I, a despised
renegade, a traitoress to my faith, surrounded by
jealous enemies,&mdash;and forsaken by my God? No!"
said she firmly, and looking up to heaven, "rather let
me die at once, than die a thousand deaths by dragging
out a degraded life of shame and remorse, to end
in eternal ruin."</p>

<p>And now the storm burst; his love spurned and
his power braved, it is not easy to describe the tumult
of passion, the more fierce from being seldom roused,
that raged in the Sultan's breast, on hearing this
address. Love, revenge, fury, seized on him by turns,
his emotions were too intense for utterance, but shown
by the terrific working of his countenance; he bit his
parched lip till the blood flowed, his eyes flashed fire,
from under his dark stormy brow, and his frame
trembled as if about to be overcome by a fit of insanity.
While this hurricane lasted, the life of Azora,
who stood terror-struck, hung by a frail thread. By
a strong effort he gradually recovered his self-possession,
and when he spoke it was with frightful
calmness; his face was deadly pale as he turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
depart, "This, then, is your decision; you are prepared
for the consequences?"</p>

<p>In her resolve not to compromise her principles,
Azora had forgotten the necessity of obtaining delay;
but having asserted these, she had now to risk the
rectification of this omission.</p>

<p>"O my lord! be not hasty," she said, "let
me have time to consider; perhaps&mdash;" but her
voice faltered; "but&mdash;if I must&mdash;die&mdash;a few
days or weeks will be a short preparation for eternity!"</p>

<p>The Sultan stopped, and fixed his eyes on her
changing countenance, in which he thought he saw
signs of her wavering, and his love prompted him to
delay while any hope remained. He replied in his
former calm tone, "Azora, I have granted your
request; two weeks shall you have for reflection. If
at the end of that time you still spurn my love, by
the tomb of the Prophet! no power on earth shall save
you."</p>

<p>He was gone. Azora remained gazing at the
closed door; it was as a dream, the time had been so
short which had transported her from her quiet home
to be the inmate of a palace with her life in danger.
Tears came to her relief, and she sought to realise her
position; she was not left long, however, to indulge
her grief, for soon after the Sultan's departure, she
was surrounded by the ladies of the hareem, who led
her away to their own rooms; and during the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that her fate was undecided, she was treated with the
greatest kindness, attired in costly dresses, adorned
with valuable jewels; and they endeavoured to amuse
her with music and tale-tellers, leaving nothing untried
to turn her from her purpose, and reduce her
to their own state of captivity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>THE FALCON CAGED.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/006.png" width="70" height="70" alt="I" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">t</span> was about eight days after the arrest of the
Jewess that Hassan mounted his horse and
rode out of the town by the south gate.
He rode onwards, engrossed by his own bitter reflections,
almost unconscious that the moon had risen
and that he was now far from the city. At the time
that he found his plans frustrated by Azora's appeal he
was overcome by rage and disappointment; as these
feelings subsided, his conscience upbraided him for
his useless perjury, by which he had brought Azora
into imminent peril without in the slightest degree
promoting his own guilty plans; he was merely a
jackal to a lion.</p>

<p>Having bitterly repented of his crime, his mind
was now constantly haunted with the dread of the
consequent death to Azora, with which he himself had
threatened her. One image pictured on his mind
seemed to have effaced and taken the place of all
others. A beautiful figure, on a pyre, with the flames
leaping around her, looked on him with a look of
reproachful agony! Sleeping or waking it was the
same, wherever he looked those sad eyes met his;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there was no escape; he was becoming a monomaniac.
His life was lonely, the only other inmate of his home
being a little orphan sister of five years old, to whom
he was much attached, but who was hardly old enough
as a companion to divert his mind; and at night he
was quite alone.</p>

<p>He now dismounted and sat down on a bank,
under the trees. The evening breeze brought to his
ear the modulated murmurs of a neighbouring rivulet;
they sounded to him as the moan of suffering. The
moon poured her beams through the foliage of olive
that overshadowed him, painting the ground with a
tracery of waving leafage, that seemed to him as
flames. The image faded for a time, as the silence of
the night soothed his harassed mind, and he felt
himself more immediately in the presence of God amid
the calm scenes of nature. The lessons of childhood,
and the principles of youth, which had not been
wholly extinguished, rose up to accuse him; and
overcome by shame and remorse, he leaned his head on
his clasped hands and wept bitterly, until his heart
was seared and his eyes were dry. Alas! man's tears
harrow, but are no relief.</p>

<p>"Salemo Alikoom," said a clear voice near him;
and remembering the lateness of the hour he started to
his feet.</p>

<p>"And on you peace," he returned to the stranger,
who now stood by his side. By the moonlight he
could see that he was tall, with an aquiline nose, and
short black beard, and dressed in the slovenly hayk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and turban of a peasant. He had stopped to water
his horse at the brook which flowed at a short distance,
and Hassan was so absorbed in his reverie that he had
approached him almost unperceived on the turf, and
had been a partial witness to his emotion.</p>

<p>"Peace to the believer!" said the stranger; "you
sit here so quietly enjoying the moonlight and the
running water, that I suppose the town gates are shut
for the night. This is a good place to camp under the
sky, and we shall be better in each other's company.
I am from Duquela, and not knowing the country, I
have rather lost my way." Saying which he pulled a
small carpet from his horse's saddle, and got out his
hobbles to tie up his horse.</p>

<p>"Not so fast," said Hassan, won by his frank
address, "I knew not it was so late; I do not sleep
here when the town is so close. Certainly you must
have lost your way, for Duquela is to the north. But
are there not more ways of entering a town than by
the gates?"</p>

<p>"By scaling the walls? You are a townsman, but
if I were caught at that I might shorten my shadow,
from which God preserve me!"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" said Hassan; "but I like you&mdash;promise
secrecy, and I will show you a way in; I discovered
it by accident."</p>

<p>"On the faith of a Moslim," said Ali el Bezz,
for it was he; and mounting their horses they rode on
to the town. Ali had been despatched by the Chief, to
Marocco, to watch over the safety of Azora, and to act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as circumstances might require for her deliverance.
He had received a minute description of the Moors,
her accusers, from Yusuf, and he felt assured that one
of them was now before him. This adventure promising
him an entrance into the town without passing
the gates, he saw at once would prove of immense
advantage to him hereafter for purposes of escape. If
he was not yet satisfied of his companion's identity, it
was not long before he had evidence of the fact.</p>

<p>"What brings you to Marocco, O Moslim?" said
Hassan as they rode side by side.</p>

<p>Ali fixed his eyes on his face, on which the moon
shone, and answered indifferently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I heard there was an infidel to be burnt for
wishing to recant."</p>

<p>Hassan started, and turned round on the speaker,
who had thus given a wrench to the weapon that
rankled in his wounded spirit, and who appeared quite
unconscious of the effect his words had produced as he
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We heard the news in our province, and I came
to see the sight. It will be a grateful sacrifice to the
Prophet. God is merciful! The Sultan is too indulgent
to the infidels."</p>

<p>"Woe to thee, O Moslim!" said Hassan in an
excited tone. "Think you the pangs and shrieks of a
son of Adam in torture can be grateful to a merciful
God? Think you the diabolical spirit of the murderers
can be pleasing to a beneficent Creator? In the
infancy of the faith the Prophet's policy allowed this;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
now it is useless, barbarous! And this is a woman!
O God! O God!" And he pressed his hands to his
eyes as though the flames blasted them.</p>

<p>Ali gazed on him with unfeigned surprise; at first
he thought he was counterplotting to mislead him,
but sincerity was too plainly marked on his haggard
face to admit of a doubt.</p>

<p>"From you, this!" he said; "is it possible? Even
as the tongue of the Cadi is before, while his hand is
behind for the bribe; so men act one thing and speak
another."</p>

<p>"And who am I?" said Hassan; "and who is
your father's son that you reflect on me as double-faced?
When have we met before?"</p>

<p>"Never! and yet I am not wrong," said Ali, fixing
on his face a stern and inquiring glance; "I am not
wrong in thinking I speak to the accuser of this
woman. Do I not speak to the principal cause of her
sufferings and death? Hassan, son of Ibr&#257;him, do I
not know you?"</p>

<p>Hassan's blood rushed to his brow and then left
his face ashy pale, as he said in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just God! is the brand of blood already on my
brow that even strangers know the murderer? The
guilt of innocent blood is even now beginning to fall
on my head."</p>

<p>"You repent?" said Ali; "then why have you
done nothing to save her?"</p>

<p>"Too late! Oh, that I could! But how do I
know," said Hassan, checking himself, "that I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
trusting to an enemy? What matter? It is known!
What have I to fear? I would give my life&mdash;a life
that is hateful to me, if it would save hers. And you,&mdash;you
have travelled far to see this scene of horror?&mdash;I
see it now!"</p>

<p>"I spoke to gain your confidence," said Ali;
"knowing you as the destroyer of the innocent, I was
your foe; now,&mdash;we are friends, and I can trust you.
But however little value you place upon your own life,
when I entrust you with a secret which would be no
less fatal to mine, you must swear to confide it to no
other. I come to save her!"</p>

<p>"I swear by my father's head never to betray
you," said Hassan; his spirit rising with the hope of
being able to co-operate in any way towards undoing
his evil work. "But how?"</p>

<p>"We shall find a way, if it please God," said Ali,
"when the time comes. I have met you in a fortunate
hour; I see by the leather thong that you wear
that you belong to the Palace guards, this will give
you the opportunity of letting the Jewess know that
help is at hand. You must see her yourself or bribe
some of the eunuchs or women. Tell her to seek
delay, and profit by any occasion we may be able to
devise to save her."</p>

<p>"I will do it," said Hassan; "at the risk of my
life I will do it."</p>

<p>The plain around the city of Marocco is very dangerous
to ride over at night, being intersected by long
lines of pits, extending from the walls towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mountains; these pits are connected with underground
canals by which the town is watered; and these again
are connected with each other by tunnels. The pits
are twenty and thirty feet deep; and from their sides
fig and other trees, and even date-palms, shoot up
above the surface of the plain, while beneath is heard
the rushing of the buried streams.</p>

<p>The horsemen were now obliged to follow each
other cautiously in single file till they came to a
fondak, or caravanserai, outside the town walls, near
one of the closed gates. The keeper of this let them
in, cursing to himself at being disturbed from his
sleep. Within, all was silent except the creaking of
the camels' teeth, as they lay ruminating and waving
their gaunt necks in the moonlight; their drivers lay
around rolled up in their hayks. After securing their
horses they let themselves out. Hassan then led the
way for about half-a-mile, until he stopped on the
brink of one of the pits above described, and, telling his
companion to follow cautiously, he lowered himself
down through the branches of a spreading tree, and
then, by holding on to roots and shrubs, came by an
easy declivity to the bottom of the pit. Being joined
by Ali, they found themselves in one of the tunnelled
passages, in which there was merely a run of water;
following this for some distance in a stooping posture,
they came to a nearly dry well, which they ascended
with ease by the projecting stones left in its sides, and
emerged, through a thicket of tangled brambles and
flowering shrubs, into the court-yard of a large abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
building about a hundred feet square, surrounded
by colonnades of massive stone pillars.</p>

<p>Ali's quick eye was not slow in calculating the
advantages of such a mode of exit from a hostile town,
and he treasured every mark in his mind for future
use in case of need. Crossing a paved court, they
went out by an unfastened gate studded with iron nails,
and found themselves in an open space within the
town; here they separated; Ali being well acquainted
with the interior of the town; after arranging where
to meet each other, without the necessity of public
recognition. It happened that Ali had been very
unwisely intrusted by the Sheik with the money for
Abdslem; and this, as we shall see, was very nearly the
means of upsetting all their plans, and at the same
time of finishing the "Falcon's" career.</p>

<p>Abdslem was beginning to feel very impatient at
the delay of the Sheik's emissary, whom he was now
bent on betraying; to prove his assumed innocence, to
the Sultan. Although he had with consummate assurance
blinded the Sultan to the evidence of his guilt,
this was wanting to restore his confidence, or ensure
his safety. On this night he was standing at his open
door, when he was accosted by a stranger muffled in
a woollen hayk. "Peace be to you! Is your name
Abdslem?"</p>

<p>"To you peace: my name is Abdslem! What
would you with him?"</p>

<p>"I would speak with him in private!"</p>

<p>"Bismillah! come into your servant's house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Abdslem could scarcely conceal his triumph; as
they went into the room he closed the door, and
lighted a three-cornered tin lamp; before doing which
he had composed his features, and then sat down opposite
his visitor.</p>

<p>"Have you received a letter from him to whom
you wrote?"</p>

<p>"I have, and by water: it was a device of cunning."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge the token; have you seen the
bearer since? He did not return."</p>

<p>"No! I understand he went on a long journey; his
head was deranged as it seemed. But if you are not
satisfied, behold the letter!"</p>

<p>"It is enough, it is the Sheik's seal; meet me to-morrow
at dusk at the palm-grove inside the Duquela
gate, there you shall receive it; you know your work."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Abdslem's eagerness to secure his
prize, his examination of the powerful frame of the
Arab showed him that he had not a chance against him
single-handed, and to take any step that would inspire
him with alarm would be to lose him altogether;
he therefore resolved to wait, and make sure of him, as
well as secure the money. "Inshallah," he said, "I
will not fail you: will you not share a soldier's supper?"</p>

<p>"May his blessing be with you, and increase your
store: better that we be not seen together. Peace."</p>

<p>"And to you peace," echoed Abdslem, as he closed
the door after him, "for to-night&mdash;but to-morrow!&mdash;half
a quintal of iron on <i>your</i> limbs shall partly
avenge me for my sufferings."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought the next day would never pass, at
length the evening wore on, and Abdslem having procured
a dozen armed men from the Ka&iuml;d of the town,
placed them in ambush close to the place of meeting;
and anxiously awaited the arrival of Ali, who did not
appear until it was quite dusk.</p>

<p>"This way," whispered Abdslem, drawing him into
the date-grove. "Come more within the shade."</p>

<p>The feathery boughs above their heads sighed
dismally in the night breeze, and one large columnar
tree lay prostrate on the earth.</p>

<p>"Let us sit here: where is the money?"</p>

<p>"It is here," said Ali, producing the bag, the next
minute he was startled by a movement amongst the
bushes behind him, and, looking round, saw figures
rising up in the dim light from their shelter.</p>

<p>"This for your treachery!" said he, dropping the
bag, and making a blow at Abdslem with his dagger;
but the other was on his guard, and avoided it by
springing back, and Ali unfortunately stumbled over
the fallen tree: the soldiers rushed upon him, and he
was overpowered by numbers, disarmed and bound,
whilst the traitor stood looking on with folded arms,
congratulating himself on his success.</p>

<p>"Inshallah! you shall live to repent of this night's
work," said Ali, "if it please God."</p>

<p>"Your days will not be long enough to see it,"
replied Abdslem, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"You will not be the first that Ali el Bezz has lived
to be revenged on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" said Abdslem, "have I been so fortunate
as to capture that notorious robber Ali el Bezz? God be
praised."</p>

<p>"The day may not be so propitious to you as you
suppose," said Ali: "'tis your turn to-day&mdash;but to-morrow&mdash;beware
the 'Falcon's Swoop.'"</p>

<p>And Abdslem quailed before his prisoner, although
bound and in his power; his triumph was also embittered
by the dread of retribution, which, if Ali escaped,
would inevitably fall on him, and even if he did not,
would sooner or later overtake him at the hands of the
Arab's family. Taking up the bag of money he accompanied
the soldiers to the prison, and, after seeing Ali
secured, returned to his own house intending to make
his report to the Sultan in the morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>BLOOD FOR BLOOD.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/002.png" width="70" height="70" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">n</span> the day that consigned Ali thus treacherously
to a dungeon, a small knot of soldiers
were sitting at the Sultan's gate, performing
a combined attack on a huge pyramid of Cuscusoo,
into which they plunged their hands half-way to the
elbow, and swallowed the large balls of granulated
flour, which they squeezed up like snow in their
fingers, and it was not till they had nearly demolished
the mutton and fowls buried in this tumulus, that they
found time to use their tongues for any other purpose.</p>

<p>"Praise be to God!" said Omar, wiping his mouth
and shaking the grains from his beard. "Did you hear
the news from Algiers?"</p>

<p>"Here, Ombark, you slave, pour water on my
hands."</p>

<p>"We heard," said Mehedin, "that the town had
been retaken, and the infidels driven into the sea,&mdash;a
curse on their fathers!"</p>

<p>"May you ride three days on a thirsty camel! Why
do you believe such lies? though I would it were true,"
said Cassim.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, O Moslemeen," said Omar, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
air of importance, "were not the infidels enticed into
the mountains by the Emir Abd el Kader? and when
they had passed the defile, did he not cut off their
retreat? Great was the slaughter of the infidels; a
price had been fixed for every head brought in, but it
had to be lowered and lowered or the Sultan's treasury
would not have paid for all; eight thousand were
slain!"</p>

<p>"To God the glory!" said Cassim; "but you,
Mahmoud, what say you to that, you, that think the
Nazarene dogs invincible?" Mahmoud was a young
man about twenty, of rather unprepossessing appearance,
with small restless grey eyes, and a gentle and
rather feminine countenance.</p>

<p>"I did not say so," answered Mahmoud calmly;
"but I know from letters which are true, received by
the Wezeer, that the whole infidel army was but seven
thousand, of which more than six thousand returned to
Djezair. May they be exterminated!"</p>

<p>"The curse of the Prophet on your house," said
Cassim to Omar; "why do you invent such lies, and
why are we such fathers of the ears to believe them?"</p>

<p>"Know you to whom you speak?" returned Omar,
flushing with rage. "Tenfold curses on your father,
and may every dog's son of your tribe be destroyed!"</p>

<p>Cassim was of Arab family, and this was too much
for him.</p>

<p>"That from <i>one</i> dog," said he, and he hurled the
pitcher, from which he was washing his hands, at
Omar's head; but for his large turban, the blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
would have been more serious: as it was, he was
stunned; but recovering, sprung to his feet, dagger
in hand, vowing vengeance; but now the others interfered
to stop the quarrel, and Cassim, cooled by the
effect of his missile, regretted his hastiness. Mahmoud
was particularly zealous in pacifying the sufferer.</p>

<p>"Shall I not drink the coward's blood?" said
Omar, struggling with Mahmoud, who was forcing
him to sheath his dagger.</p>

<p>"What will you gain by that, or by eating him
too? Curse the devil, and be friends; of all things I
hate a revengeful temper; he is sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Who can stand such treatment?" said Omar,
trying to swallow his rage. Eventually, after several
relapses, the quarrel was made up, and the two were
kissing each other's heads, in token of forgiveness,
when they were joined by Abd el Aziz.</p>

<p>"I have just been told," said he, "that the Cafila
to Timbuctoo has been plundered in the Beled-el-Jerede
by the Woled Abou Sebah, and some of the
people killed. I hope, Mahmoud, that your brother
Mohammed did not go with them; it was said that he
did."</p>

<p>Mahmoud turned deadly pale.</p>

<p>"Where had you this news?" said he, rising, "for
I must know the truth."</p>

<p>"The person who told me was the old Fez merchant
in the Kaisaria; he was one of them, and has lost
all his goods."</p>

<p>Mahmoud hastily departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor youth! if his brother be killed, woe to
him; his life will be darkened, for he loved him
exceedingly."</p>

<p>The love which existed between these two brothers
was known to them all; they had been together from
childhood; the quiet, unassuming disposition of the
younger accorded well with the somewhat wild and
bragging character of his brother, and his retiring
habits preventing him mixing much with others of his
station, made him cleave with more affectionate dependence
to his brother; he had endeavoured to dissuade
him from this journey, but his love of enterprise
had prevailed. And now, with a fearful dread that
they were parted for ever, Mahmoud made his way
with rapid steps towards the Kaisaria, through long
streets of shops, shaded from the sun by date-boughs
supported by poles thrown across the street from wall
to wall, hustling his way through crowds of people,
water-carriers, sweetmeat-sellers, Delals hawking their
goods, camels, mules, and horses, until, overcome with
heat and fatigue, he reached the bazaar, where shops,
packed with shawls, scarfs, silk handkerchiefs, and
European goods, invited the purchaser. Here he was
informed that the object of his search had gone to the
fondak. The story of the plunder of the caravan was
in every one's mouth. Resting a minute to take a
draught of water to moisten his parched lips, and
which the water-carrier, with his usual "Allaw Kerim!"
emitted from the neck of a goat-skin gathered in his
hand, into a brass bowl: Mahmoud set off on another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
long round, and at length found the Fez merchant
sitting in one of the empty partitions of the colonnade,
round the court-yard of the fondak. His face was
woe-begone, and his fingers as usual combed his grey
beard, as he ruminated over his losses, when he was
addressed by Mahmoud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Salamo Alikoom; Sidi Idries! were you with the
Cafila that was plundered in the Desert?"</p>

<p>"Woe unto me!&mdash;who else?" said the little man
with a groan, and then began, half to himself, enumerating
his losses: "Were there not three bales of
silk, worth six hundred dollars, five camel-loads of
grocery and spice, four hundred and fifty dollars at
least, not to count expenses and camel hire. Woe is
me, to leave my own shop, to be ruined in my old age,
besides this there were two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you can inform me&mdash;" interposed Mahmoud,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Is it not I that can give you information of the
whole affair? Have I not paid dearly for experience?
As I was saying,&mdash;Two bales of cowries, upwards of
140,000, one hundred and forty dollars."</p>

<p>"But what I want to ask you&mdash;" said Mahmoud,
beginning to lose all patience.</p>

<p>"Little by little, my friend," said Sidi Idries, "and
I will tell you all; little by little the camel gets into
the saucepan. To think of the slaves, and the gold-dust,
and the ivory, I have lost. Our lives were
saved&mdash;yes&mdash;God is merciful&mdash;but what is life
without the means of living&mdash;the sum total&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Mahmoud's patience here gave way&mdash;</p>

<p>"For God's sake, hear me!" thundered he,
striking his clenched hand on the shopboard, and
putting a sudden stop to the merchant's volubility.
"I wish to know if any of your company were killed
by the Arabs? It is not from curiosity, but my
brother went with them, and has not returned: I fear
some evil has befallen him."</p>

<p>His earnest and excited manner had driven the
old man's losses from his head for the present, and he
told him that he had reason to believe that one of the
soldiers of their party had lost his life; and his
description of his appearance left no doubt on Mahmoud's
mind that it was his brother. His head
swam, and a faintness at his heart made him reach to
the doorway for support, and he sank on the shop-sill,
the sweat streaming down his face. The old merchant
was moved nearly to tears at witnessing his
suffering.</p>

<p>"It is the will of God, O my son!" he said;
"have patience: was it not written?"</p>

<p>"There is more written, O my father," said he;
"there is vengeance!" and he wiped the cold sweat
from his brow; "but tell me everything&mdash;tell me
all!"</p>

<p>The merchant then told him, that after they were
plundered and stripped, an Arab, who had gone in
pursuit of the soldiers, had returned with a soldier's
horse instead of his own, and carrying his clothes and
arms; and that when they started on their return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
they had passed the body of a horse and man, lying
on the plain in the moonlight, with a flock of vultures
gorged and slumbering at a little distance, until daylight
should enable them to renew their feast.</p>

<p>"Now I remember," he said, "the soldier's name
was Mohammed."</p>

<p>Mahmoud's worst fears were confirmed.</p>

<p>"Is it known who the Arab was?" he inquired,
with a quivering voice.</p>

<p>"Arabs are like dates," said the merchant, "one
like another; but this one was not of the flock; he
gave us his name himself; he was the famous Ali el Bezz!"</p>

<p>"I have heard it before," said Mahmoud, as he
turned slowly away to dream of vengeance; "but now
it is written here"&mdash;and he struck his brow&mdash;"in
fire!"</p>

<p>He returned to his home, and though he wept in
private the loss of his brother, he subdued his emotion,
when he was obliged to repair to the Palace-guard,
and appear among his comrades; but he sat abstracted
and taciturn, torturing his brain with plans of
vengeance. If Ali had been living in the town, he
would have slain him by treachery, or hired assassins;
any means seemed excusable to compass his revenge;
but how reach him in the Desert; and who would aid
him against so redoubtable a foe, who was supposed to
possess a charmed life? He felt at last reduced to the
painful necessity of waiting until his enemy should
venture to the town, when he resolved to hunt him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
down at any risk. He little knew at the time that his
revenge was brought to his own door, and he had only
to arise and strike.</p>

<p>His comrades, knowing the cause of his melancholy,
forbore to intrude on him. They had just
finished their supper, and were preparing to set the
watch for the night, when Abdslem joined them. He
was in high spirits, and exhibited a handsome embroidered
silk scarf, which he unwound from his head,
for their admiration.</p>

<p>"Look at this," he said; "I received it this
morning from the Sultan's own hands; may he be
exalted; I told you I should not be long in disgrace."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," said Mehedin, while it passed
round; "but what great thing have you done to
merit it?"</p>

<p>"Not a small exploit. Did I not seize an Arab
spy with my own hand; and who do you think he
turned out to be? Why, no other than that dare-devil
Sheik, Ali el Bezz!" and Abdslem twirled the scarf
round his head in a handsome turban above his ugly
face.</p>

<p>Mahmoud, who had at first paid little attention to
the speaker, sprang forward at the electrical sound of
that name.</p>

<p>"Who?" he said; "repeat that name," laying
his hand on Abdslem's shoulder, while his features
worked, his eyes glared, and his whole frame trembled.</p>

<p>Abdslem looked at him, half doubting his sanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you," he repeated, "I have seized the
notorious robber Ali el Bezz; and he is now as safely
lodged as walls and chains can keep him."</p>

<p>"Thanks be to God!" exclaimed Mahmoud, grinding
his teeth, and raising his clenched hands, while a
satanic smile overspread his countenance; "he is in
my power; my revenge is sure!" and gathering up
his cloak, he rushed out of the gate.</p>

<p>As he came into the street the moon threw her
pale light on his haggard face, and reminded him that
it was now too late to take further steps that night.
He returned to his own house, and threw himself on
his mattress, but sleep came not to the relief of his
fevered frame; and his heated brain pictured to him
his murdered brother, pale and bleeding, reproaching
him for his delay.</p>

<p>The dogma of the Koran, which in practice is the
Moorish law, is "eye for eye," "tooth for tooth,"
"life for life;" if the offence is proved, the Sultan
himself hardly dares to refuse retaliation on the wrongdoer,
and if the accuser perseveres in demanding
justice, he must deliver up the accused to his vengeance.</p>

<p>Before the day dawned, Mahmoud was sitting at
the inner gate of the palace, waiting impatiently till
the Sultan should ride forth to the audience-hall
(M'Shouar); and when after several long hours he came
out, surrounded by his guards and attendants, there
was heard a voice clear above the noise of the cavalcade,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Justice! O my lord! Justice! Blood for blood!"</p>

<p>The Sultan ordered the speaker to be brought before
him, asked him the reason of his complaint, and
whom he accused.</p>

<p>"My lord, I accuse Ali el Bezz," said Mahmoud;
"he is now in prison, and I demand his life for the life
of my brother, whom he has murdered."</p>

<p>"How know you that he hath done this?" said the
Sultan, "we must have proof."</p>

<p>"The witnesses are all those who have returned
from the plunder of the Cafila."</p>

<p>"We will inquire further into this matter," said
the Sultan, "and if we find that your charge is true,
we may not deny you justice."</p>

<p>Then giving the necessary orders, he rode on,
leaving Mahmoud, to whom every hour of suspense
seemed an age, sitting at the gates to await his return.
It was mid-day, and he was still at his station; no food
had passed his lips, and the call of the crier from the
Mosque had rolled over him unheard, but as soon as
the Sultan re-entered, the same clear voice rung in
his ears,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Justice! my lord! Justice! Blood for blood!"</p>

<p>The Sultan made a gesture of impatience. From
the inquiries he had caused to be made, he found that
the charge was true; but as the Arab had been taken
in a political intrigue, he wished to spare his life for
the present, with the view of obtaining information
from him, and making use of him for his own service.</p>

<p>"Bring him before us;" and Mahmoud advanced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"What sum would pay for this?" said the Sultan.
"We would compromise this matter; of more use to
you will be the fine of redemption than the death of
the Arab: this cannot restore your brother, it was
written."</p>

<p>Mahmoud's lip curled, and his eye glistened, "My
lord's will is his slave's," he said, "and the will of the
Khalifa of the Prophet will not wish to swerve from
the Prophet's law. Shall I sell my brother's blood?
If," said he, with fierce energy, "for every drop of
the Arab's base blood, you offered me your hands full
of gold, it should be as dross. No! not for his
weight in diamonds would I forego my just revenge,
or lose the satisfaction of witnessing the last groan
issue from the gasping soul of my brother's murderer!"</p>

<p>From the intense vindictiveness of his spirit, the
Sultan saw that it would be useless to combat his
resolve; and as he was not very intent on saving
Ali; within a few hours Mahmoud received the order
to the keeper of the prison, directing him to deliver
Ali up to him for execution.</p>

<p>His delight at receiving this order amounted to
rapture; he kissed the Sultan's seal affixed to it, and
placed it next his heart, as though it had been a token
from his beloved; clasping it there he hurried to his
house, dreading lest anything should occur to change
the Sultan's mind, and intervene between him and his
revenge. Arrived at home, he slung on his powder-horn
and bullet-pouch, and taking his gun, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
his impatience did not permit him to load, he hastened
to the public prison.</p>

<p>Hassan on leaving his companion had proceeded to
fulfil his promise of warning Azora. Ali was right in
supposing him well acquainted with the topography
of the palace, from his position; and he was, moreover,
intimate with many of the attendants of the household.
He first provided himself with a bottle of the
strong spirit which the Jews distil from raisins, put
on a dark coloured dress, and then set off for the
palace. Avoiding the main entrance, he skirted the
walls till he came to a small side door, here he rolled
a stone in a handkerchief, and gave five muffled
knocks; after a short pause, the door opened of itself,
the latch being raised by a string from above; he
entered in the dark, and ascending a narrow stair in
the thickness of the wall, entered a small square
chamber lighted by a brass lamp; here on a carpet
sat one of the Sultan's chief eunuchs; he had a
flabby face, a heavy eye, and was very corpulent; his
dress was of fine materials, and he wore an enormous
white turban on his head; a bristle grew here and
there on his chin.</p>

<p>"How is uncle Mobarik?" said Hassan, after the
usual salutes.</p>

<p>"Well, O cheerer of my heart," said Mobarik
"how long it is since I have seen the son of my
uncle!"</p>

<p>"I had work, O my friend, and could not come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we have heard. Allaw Ackbar. Work, yes,
we have heard."</p>

<p>"And then, O my uncle, I like not to come
empty-handed, and it is so difficult now to pass the
stuff through the gate of the Jews' town; but there,"
producing the bottle, "is some true water of life; the
Sultan does not drink better. None of your fig or
date brandy, but distilled from grapes, and flavoured
with anise: try it."</p>

<p>"Is it lawful, O light of my eyes?" said Mobarik,
while his own eyes twinkled as he poured out half a
tumbler full.</p>

<p>"Is it not lawful?" said Hassan.</p>

<p>"The Koran forbids it," said Mobarik.</p>

<p>"The Koran does not forbid it," said Hassan; "am
I not a taleb? Hear the Koran! Thus it is written&mdash;'Intoxicating
drink is created for man, but the
harm of it is greater than its benefit; therefore, O
Moslem, forbear.'" Mobarik had drained his glass
before the quotation was finished. "And," continued
Hassan, "the great commentator, Kumalodeen, interprets
this, 'To those who can drink in moderation and
without harm, it is permitted&mdash;to others, not.'"</p>

<p>"Truly, thou art a lawyer, and wisdom cometh out
of thy mouth; doth it not warm the stomach and cheer
the heart?"</p>

<p>When Mobarik had finished about half the bottle
to his own share, Hassan only helping him for form's
sake, his ashy-brown face had acquired a sort of glow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and he seemed in the happiest temper for Hassan's
purpose. It was no easy task for him to talk slightingly
of what caused him such intense pain, but he forced
himself to bear it.</p>

<p>"So you have heard," said he, "of Hassan converting
the infidel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Mobarik, taking off his turban,
and with a comical leer on his face; "the hawk struck
the quail, and the eagle bore it off."</p>

<p>"God is great! There is more game a-field," said
Hassan; "but how heard you the affair?"</p>

<p>"Is not the infidel in my ward?" said Mobarik.</p>

<p>"Then she is in the garden room," said Hassan;
"that is all right."</p>

<p>"What garden room? and what is right?" said
Mobarik, whose professional vigilance was awakened.</p>

<p>"Hast thou forgotten, O fat man! the carpenter's
lad that was taken in to repair the door-lock?"</p>

<p>Before he could say more, Mobarik had closed his
mouth with his hand,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wilt thou be silent, O unfortunate? If thou
didst escape, thank God; art thou weary of thy
life?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," said Hassan, "but thou wert
well paid for that affair;" and he slapped the pocket of
his caftan, making the money that it contained ring.
"Now, uncle Mobarik, put on your turban, and listen
to me. Shall I put you in the way of pocketing a
nice little sum of fifty dollars?" The flabby face
grinned. "Good! I must see this Jewess." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mouth fell open, the eyes rounded, and with his turban
stuck on awry, any one less heavy at heart than Hassan
must have been convulsed with laughter. His mouth
then closed tight, and his head shook from side to
side.</p>

<p>"Am I an Afreet of fifty lives," said he, "that I
should tamper with the Sultan's hareem?"</p>

<p>"Mobarik, you are a father of the ears, any one
may see a Jewess. Hareem indeed! if it had been a
Mooress, there would be danger, besides, it is only a
letter; see, you would not lose fifty dollars?"</p>

<p>"Give me the money; I will give her the letter."</p>

<p>"Do you see my horns growing, O wise one? Or
have I been eating dates till the honey runs out of my
eyes? Do pillared dollars grow on trees, that you
have only to raise your hand and pick? Now, take
another glass, and listen to what I say. I have been
offered one hundred dollars, to give a letter into the
infidel's own hand. I refused, unless I knew the contents;
it was read to me, for it is in the Hebrew
character&mdash;see, it is open. In it, they beg her to
submit to her fate, as all they have done to obtain her
liberty has been without success, and it is better for
her to be a Moslem than lose her life. I took the
money, and promised, as I knew you would not refuse
to help me."</p>

<p>"Then you were mistaken," said Mobarik, sulkily,
"I will not risk my head."</p>

<p>Hassan looked at him steadily for a minute, "I
swear by Allah, that <i>you</i> shall help me, and that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
will not leave until I have seen the Jewess; and now I
will show you that it is safer, and more profitable for
you to consent, than to refuse; look at me, I am a
stronger man than you, would it not be easy to me, O
my uncle, to bind you, and go without your leave? I
know the way, you would not dare to give an alarm,
for my being in here, and your friend there in the
bottle, would be sufficient to cost you the skin of your
back, and perhaps your head. But what is there to prevent
my killing you," he continued, advancing towards
him with his hand on his dagger&mdash;"we are alone&mdash;but
for our old friendship?"</p>

<p>Mobarik had shrunk into the corner, in real alarm,
his face having again assumed its ashy hue: "Let us
be friends," said he, "give me the money: have you
not sworn that I shall help you, and an oath must be
kept?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Hassan, "and then it is a good action
to persuade the Jewess to her conversion. I will stay but
the time for an answer to the letter: go on before to see
that all is safe."</p>

<p>Mobarik having received the money, led the way
down-stairs, crossed a court-yard, and unlocking a side
door, admitted Hassan, directing him to lock the door
on his return, for which purpose he left the key in the
lock. Hassan found himself amongst the fruit trees,
with which the interior court was thickly planted; and
under their shadow, he made his way towards a light
which shone out through a glass door, at a little distance
and which was half-open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Azora was reclining on the cushions, one hand supporting
her head, while the other rested on a small
Hebrew Bible, which lay open before her. A large
brass lamp, on an embossed pillar, stood on the carpet,
and threw its light on her sweet, calm face. She was
so deeply absorbed that she did not notice the entrance
of Hassan, whose tread was dulled by the soft carpet,
and he stood gazing, with clasped hands, on that face
so pale and yet so peaceful; and though his affection
for her was revived, it was in a hallowed form, and his
heart smote him for the part he had taken in bringing
one so good and so beautiful into her present peril. A
deep-drawn sigh aroused her from her meditations, and
made her aware of his presence. In her present position,
her mind was not in a state to be startled by such a
circumstance; her first feeling was surprise, and the
next the fear of the consequences to himself. She felt
resigned to her fate, and no feelings of ill-will could
harbour in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Hassan," she said, rising, "am I not free from
your presence even here?"</p>

<p>"No!" said he, "that time is past, but repentance
has come too late to undo what has been done."</p>

<p>"God be praised!" interrupted Azora, "but know
you your peril if found here? Fly! lest you also fall
a victim."</p>

<p>"She is of the angels," muttered Hassan. "I am
in her power, a word would avenge her, yet she only
thinks of my danger; I, the cause of her death. Yes,
I, her murderer. Oh, my brain! Allah, have mercy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
That I take this risk," he continued, addressing her,
"is a proof that I now speak truth. I am sent to
warn you that you have friends, who are working for
and watching over your safety; you also must watch
every opportunity, and profit by it. The Sheik of the
Seba&iuml;e, who gave a pledge of protection to your father,
has vowed to save you. I know not what threats or
torture may be intended by the tyrant; but be sure that
in the hour of danger friends will be near, and may
God deliver you. Here is a token you must remember."
And he gave her a slip of paper, with a few Hebrew
words upon it.</p>

<p>"It is well," said Azora; "if God has raised me
up friends, may He prosper their endeavours; if they
fail, God's will be done! But haste&mdash;save yourself!"</p>

<p>Hassan was turning to depart, but stopped and
said, with a trembling voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Azora! though torment wait me, I <i>cannot</i> go
till you have granted one request."</p>

<p>"I, what is there in <i>my</i> power to grant? I, a captive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, much, much!" and he fell on his knees, and
raised his hands in supplication. "Forgiveness!&mdash;I ask&mdash;forgiveness
for the wrong I have done you, and&mdash;O
God!&mdash;what may yet be&mdash;may He avert it. Can you,
oh, can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Can I forgive you?" she repeated, raising her
eyes to heaven with a smile, "as I hope for pardon
from Him before whose throne I must ere long appear&mdash;from
my soul I forgive you! But fly! I hear
sounds approaching!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>A scalding tear fell on her hand, as Hassan pressed
it to his lips, and then, disappearing through the doorway,
he retraced his steps, locked the gate of the garden,
and rejoined Mobarik, who was anxiously waiting to let
him out.</p>

<p>"I have the answer," he said; "may your sleep be
blessed. When shall we have another bottle of keef?"</p>

<p>"When I carry pebbles and eggs in the same bag,
O son of my uncle," replied Mobarik, as he closed the
door after him.</p>

<p>Soon after he had left, the female attendants summoned
Azora to retire for the night; before which, she
had looked at the paper left with her by Hassan, it
contained only these words, "The black horse."</p>

<p>It was the next day that Hassan heard with the
greatest dismay of the seizure of Ali el Bezz, which
threatened to frustrate all attempts for the Jewess's
safety. In the Moorish prisons the principal reliance
is placed on the heavy chains with which they are
shackled for the safe keeping of prisoners, the rooms
being inefficient, and the guards careless; the shackles
are riveted on the arms and legs by a smith, and the
chains terminate in a massive ring in the wall. Hassan,
as one of the Sultan's guards, knew that he would have
no difficulty in communicating with the prisoner without
suspicion; and the first thing he did before repairing
thither was to purchase a large triangular file, which
he concealed in his waist-belt. As soon as Ali had been
secured as described above, he sat down on a stone, the
only furniture of the cell, overcome with shame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
vexation at allowing himself to be so entrapped. When
this passed, his mind turned to other and more tormenting
thoughts. The vision of his black tent on the
Desert rose painfully to his imagination; he saw his wife
looking out for his return, and all the trifling, but to
him important details associated with his home, gave
poignancy to his suffering; he sprang to his feet, only
to be reminded by the irons on his limbs that he was
no longer free!</p>

<p>He sat down and endeavoured to compose himself
to think over his chances of escape; he examined his
chains and their connexion with the wall, and was
forced to the conclusion that unaided there was no
hope! It was early in the morning when he heard a
voice, which he recognised, outside the iron-barred
window of his cell, and his heart bounded with hope.</p>

<p>"These poor devils of prisoners would be starved
but for the charity of the Moslem. I will begin this
morning with a good action, and spend half a pe&ccedil;eta on
them. O thou son of evil fortune!" said Hassan, coming
to the grating, "take the alms of the Moslem, for the
love of God." (And in a lower voice, "Cut the links
next to your arms and legs.") "I am poor, O my
brother, or I would give thee more. (You can overpower
and gag the keeper of the prison.) Pray to the Saint Sidi
Abd el Kader for me. (Your horse will be in waiting
where we parted yesterday.) God give you a safe
deliverance!"</p>

<p>He then sauntered away, while Ali, overjoyed, set
to work to free himself from his chains, which, allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for the interruptions he would be subject to by the
coming in and out of the keeper, he expected to accomplish
by noon. The links were made of soft iron,
about ten inches long each, the rod of which they were
forged being three inches in circumference; he found,
after cutting through one, that by an exertion of
strength, using his hands and feet, he could force it
open and release the shackle; he had disengaged himself
from three of his chains, and had cut through the
remaining one on his left leg, which only required to
be forced open; his heart already beat high, with the
anticipation of liberty, when he was again disturbed
by the approach of the keeper. Concealing the ends
of his chains in his hayk, he huddled down by the
wall, looking sulky, until he should leave as usual.
This time, however, the keeper brought with him a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Be it known unto thee, O enemy of God!" said
the keeper, "that thou art convicted of the murder of
a Moslem named Mohammed. And know further, that
his brother, named Mahmoud, has claimed thy life for
the life of his brother, according to the law, and has
brought an order from the Sultan (may his throne be
exalted!) to deliver thee unto him."</p>

<p>He then turned and left the room, the door of
which he closed after him; and the avenger of blood
and his victim were left together.</p>

<p>Ali at once saw the extent of his danger, and that,
if he failed to liberate himself from the remaining
chain, his life was ended. Luckily for him Mahmoud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
had brought his gun unloaded; and as he was in no
hurry, now that he seemed sure of his prey, the delay
would give Ali the opportunity of making an effort to
disengage himself from the chain. Revenge, like all
fierce pleasures, is chiefly delightful in anticipation.
Imagination exaggerating the enjoyment it promises,
these feelings gradually die away as the time for action
approaches; for if the excitement increased in proportion
up to that point, the overstrained mind would
render the body powerless to carry its plans into
practice with firmness and success. Mahmoud was
disappointed; he fixed his gaze on his victim expecting
to see him quail with dread; he came to luxuriate in
his fears, and gloat over his despair as he begged
his forfeit life, and he anticipated the delight, when
he begged for mercy, of planting the death-shot
in his shrinking heart. But Ali returned his gaze
undaunted, and he felt that his vengeance was incomplete.</p>

<p>He began charging his gun; his voice trembled
with rage as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O dog! you do not fear death? We shall
see. You pretend to look calm, so does the wolf,&mdash;yet
it dies. I do not believe you,&mdash;and now I see
you tremble."</p>

<p>Ali's frame was quivering with the muscular exertion
of forcing open the stubborn iron.</p>

<p>"Fear death!" echoed the Arab, with a scornful
smile. "I have seen it too often; let your father's
son tremble; your brother would have killed me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
I took his life. I shrink not from the penalty; take
my life and be satisfied."</p>

<p>"He confesses it, and braves me!" muttered
Mahmoud through his clenched teeth, and his eyes
glared as he dashed the fatal bullet into the barrel and
rammed it down on the charge. "Have I lived to be
braved by a vile Bedawi! Your life pay for his?
No! not the lives of all your tribe; but," continued
he, "though you do not fear, have you not left
those in your accursed tent, whose pangs will contribute
to my vengeance? Ha! have I stung you? you
shall think of that for a space, before I take your
dog's life."</p>

<p>The heart of Ali sunk within him, as he found
himself utterly unable, without betraying his exertions,
to force open the iron link; his only hope of escape
from death was the probability of Mahmoud's coming
within his reach; the remaining chain which held him
was four feet long, and this with his own stride,
would give him a lunge of eight feet, and as it is usual
in these cases of judicial murder to put the muzzle of
the gun to the victim's breast, the chance was possible.</p>

<p>Mahmoud, however, having primed his gun, seemed
determined not to give him that chance of escape, and
free from all apprehension of losing his revenge, pleased
himself with cat-like ferocity, in playing with his
victim. He went to the far end of the small room,
and began taking deliberate aim, first at his victim's
head and then at his heart. Ali shifted his position
from side to side to deceive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you shoot?" he said, "you could
not hit a camel at that distance! See how his hand
shakes! his heart would shake more if I was free!
There, finish! is not your brother waiting for his
revenge?"</p>

<p>Mahmoud, who had controlled himself all this
time with the greatest difficulty, could no longer restrain
his fury; he rushed upon him to place the
muzzle to his breast with a yell of rage, when Ali, with
one bound, sprang upon his foe, and before he could
recover from his astonishment, had seized the gun,
and felled him to the earth with the iron manacle on
his wrist, completing his work by shooting him
through the head with his own gun:&mdash;and he was
free!</p>

<p>Having succeeded thus far, his next care was to
secure his retreat; first disengaging himself from the
chains, he fastened the door within, and then hastily
changed his own upper dress for that of his senseless
enemy, the soldier's high yellow boots concealed the
shackles on his legs, while the manacles on his wrists
were covered by the folds of his hayk; he gave a
paler tinge to his bronzed face, with the white wash
dust from the walls, he then attired Mahmoud in his
coarse hayk, and taking the precaution of reloading
the gun, he walked quietly out, with the hood of the
burnoose muffling his face, the keeper only making a
passing remark reflecting on his tardiness. As he
expected, he found Mahmoud's horse at the gate, this
he mounted, and pursued his way at a slow pace, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
striking into the less frequented streets, until he
entered a long arched passage; here he dismounted,
looped the bridle to the high pommel, and fixing a
small thorny branch under the girth to act as spurs,
he let him loose, and the horse bounded down the
street kicking and plunging, and disappeared round
the corner; he thus cut off the clue to his discovery,
should he be pursued, and then made his way to
where his own horse awaited him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>SHEIK AYOUB.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/003.png" width="70" height="70" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">he</span> Chief of the Woled Abou Sebah had long
been meditating an inroad into the Sultan's
territory, and this, the arrival of Yusuf had
caused him to accelerate. After despatching Ali,
he gave orders to strike the tents, and be ready for
marching before dawn, consequently, instead of the
stillness which usually prevailed during the night, all
was bustle and confusion in preparation for departure,
large fires blazed in all directions, round which flitted
the dark forms of the Arabs, arranging their arms and
accoutrements, packing tents, saddling horses; while
the din of hammers, the screaming of camels,
and neighing of horses, mingled with the voice of
a multitude, and the surging swell of thousands in
motion.</p>

<p>Before sunrise every tent was struck, and everything
loaded for the march; the whole company now
separated into two bands, the larger, consisting of the
women, and children, and aged, on camels, and the
flocks, with a sufficient number of men for their protection;
these took their course southward further into the
Desert. The other band of about five thousand horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
armed with double guns across their pommels,
besides swords and dirks, were to march northward
taking Teradant in their route. Each man carried a
small supply of provisions, consisting of dates and
barley-meal. Several hundred camels accompanied
them, carrying spare ammunition and provisions, but
though starting so lightly equipped they had every
intention of returning more heavily laden with the
spoils of their more industrious but less warlike neighbours.
As the first troop was diminishing from view,
the chief commanded his standard to be unfurled, and
mounted his charger: an attendant handed him a bowl
of milk, which he first tasted, and then poured over
his horse's mane, a ceremony to invoke protection during
the journey. He galloped down the front of his line
of men, or rather the semicircle which they formed,
with a word of salute or kindness to all that came
within his ken, he then stopped in their front, and thus
addressed them, in a clear, sonorous voice: "Praise be
to the one God! Brothers, what shall I say? Will
ye be slaves of the Sultan, or will ye stand by the
banner of Hamed Ibn Ishem?"</p>

<p>A loud shout of "Long live our chief!" drowned
for an instant his voice, and all again was silent.</p>

<p>"It is well, brothers! Ye are true sons of Ishmael,
and when the battle comes, let every Arab stand by his
brother. What! shall the lord of the Sahel pay tribute
to the son of the town? Shall the warrior bow to the
plough-driver? Henceforth shall every man live free
in his tent, without fear of having the bread taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his children, to raise taxes for a stranger. Does the
Sultan want tribute, let him come and seek it; but
instead of gold, he will find lead and steel, and the
bones of his troops shall whiten the red sands of the
Sahara. We now go north, to repay ourselves for what
we have already lost. The provinces are rich, and we
will reap a hundredfold for what has been taken from
us. But one word of warning: let no innocent blood
bring a curse on our tents. I command and entreat ye
to respect women and children, and not to hurt the
unresisting; let mercy follow submission, then shall
success attend our arms, a blessing attend our steps,
and we shall return to our tents in peace. Brothers,
shall we pray?"</p>

<p>All then with raised hands joined in the Fetha, or
prayer of praise and adoration, after which they commenced
their march to the province of Suse; and when
far away, they looked back on the scene of their late
camp, there was nothing visible but a broad dark spot,
over which the vultures were hovering.</p>

<p>Various surmises were passing among the Arabs,
with respect to the object of Yusuf's coming, and
having concluded that he had brought intelligence
favourable to this expedition, they were well disposed
towards him, independently of his being the guest of
their chief. As soon as the Sheik could find time, he
rode up to Yusuf, who was mounted on an ambling
mule, plodding along in a rather desponding state of
mind, lest he should return too late, and find Azora's
fate beyond their help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cheer up, O friend," said the Sheik, "we have
sent Sheik Ali on in haste to Marocco; he is to be
trusted, fear not. I have now much to attend to, but
I have appointed you a companion and protector on the
road; Sheik Ayoub Er Rami is a good man, he is, as God
made him, a good warrior and honest, but fond of
hearing himself talk; will it not amuse you by the
way? He has been in the towns, and is accustomed to
strangers, some of these Arabs of mine never saw a
house, and when they do, they only wonder why you
should build houses of stone that will last longer than
you can use them. Sheik Ayoub!" he called out, and
Ayoub, who had been discussing with his friends the
probable plunder they would reap, dashed forward to
the side of the chief, bringing his horse on his haunches,
and ploughing up the sand with his hind hoofs.</p>

<p>"You have a good seat and a good horse," said the
chief smiling, as he shook the dust from his burnoose.
"This, our guest, is placed in your charge, you will
protect him against friend or foe, until I relieve you.
Have I not put confidence in you? and is it not well
placed?"</p>

<p>Ayoub bowed to his horse's crest. "There is not
an Arab who would not risk his life for the guest of
our chief: therefore, O Sheik, friends we fear not: and
may the Prophet put him in danger of an enemy, that
I may prove myself worthy of your trust."</p>

<p>"Avert the omen!" said the Sheik, "I shall be
satisfied without such proof. May your prayer not be
granted!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Ayoub was a small, neat figure, with a pair of
formidable moustaches, a pointed beard, but no
whiskers; he had formerly lived in Marocco, taking
service under the Sultan, there he had been obliged to
adopt the caftan and turban, but had very soon returned
to the independence of the Desert; this, however, had
given him more neatness in his dress, and an affectation
of knowledge bordering on conceit. He was a great
talker, which was facilitated, as his comrades jokingly
assured him, by the absence of several teeth, lost in
some fray; he was well knit, though short, and when
laughed at for his size, he was always ready with a
proverb, as "Iron is sold by the quintal, steel by the
ounce." The only peculiarity about him in other respects,
was that he carried a brace of small pocket
pistols in his belt, this joined to his being a good rifle-shot,
had acquired him the surname "Er Rami, the
Marksman."</p>

<p>"My name," said he in answer to Yusuf's inquiry,
"your lord's name (may peace attend it!) is Ayoub Ibn
Aisa Ibn Yarib Seba&iuml;e, they choose to call me Er Rami,
to laugh at my beard, because I carry these children of
the gun; but when they have seen them bite, young as
they are, they do not laugh at them in the hand of an
enemy. Then they open the mouth of astonishment.
A Christian gave them to me, may the Prophet enlighten
him before his death! They are good men, the
Christians, men of trust, they would not break their
word to save a ship. The Moors are not worthy to be
their grooms; but give me your ear," said he, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from his saddle towards Yusuf, apparently to whisper
his secret, when he shouted out, "they eat pig!"</p>

<p>"Oh, abominable!" exclaimed the equally scandalized
Jew; and all the Christians' merits were wrecked
on the reef of prejudice.</p>

<p>Yusuf, however, nothing loth to relieve the monotony
of the journey, by encouraging the loquaciousness
of his companion, asked him where he had met with
Christians, and if he had been to Suerah.</p>

<p>Ayoub, only too glad to find a listener, brightened
up as he slung his long bridle round his neck, and let
his horse follow his own pace, that his hands might be
free to accompany his tongue. "Gently, child," this
was to his horse, who knew as well as his master, that
he had work before him, and had no intention of fretting.
"Inshallah, I have seen things, as you say. El Suerah!
Yes, I have seen El Suerah. The Nazarenes call it
Mogadore, after the sanctuary of the Saint Sidi Mogdul
(his peace be on us!). Well, before I went to the
merchant's house, I said to my head, 'If Ayoub does
not dress himself like a Ka&iuml;d, or a Taleb, the infidel
will despise him, and I shall appear small in their eyes:'
so I put on a turban of white muslin, as big as that,"
holding his hands a foot and a half from each side of
his head, "then I put on a green caftan and a hayk,
perfumed with sandal-wood, and followed by a boy
with a present of dates and oranges, I went to the
merchant's house. As I was going to enter, out comes
a black soldier, who was sitting in the gate.</p>

<p>"'Where are you going in peace?' said he, he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not see whom he was speaking to, for his eyes were one
half closed with fat, and the other half with importance.</p>

<p>"'Going,' said I, 'to see the merchant,' and I
advanced.</p>

<p>"'Tell me who you are,' said he, 'and I will
inquire if you can be admitted.'</p>

<p>"This set me laughing. 'Did I come to see the
Sultan?' said I; 'when I do, I don't expect to find such
a gate-keeper, so take your head from whence you
brought it, and find a place to pray in.' And I
pushed him out of my path. But my slipper-counter
barred the doorway again.</p>

<p>"'You are not in the woods,' says he, quite furious,
'people's houses are not to be entered by force here, as
you will find when you eat the stick, for all your turban
is as big as a Cuscusoo dish.'</p>

<p>"I was beginning to lose patience. 'I tell you
what, O dog of evil race, if we were in the woods, you
would defile your beard in the dust, when you presumed
to approach my presence; as it is, if you don't
save your breath, and stop your tongue from wagging,
I shall be compelled to shorten it an inch.' And I
was thinking seriously of doing so, when the merchant,
attracted by the dispute, looked over the upper gallery
to know what was the matter. 'Is this the way, O
merchant,' said I, 'that you treat your guests? Behold
I come to seek the shadow of your tents, when this
evil-eyed slipper-hunter, who calls himself a Moslem,
presumes to stop me at the gate; and if it is by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
orders, it is no credit to your hospitality,' The merchant
looked at me with a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>"'Welcome, O my friend!' said he, in the tongue
of the Arab. 'I always tell this slave of the
Sultan, to distinguish people; he knows not the difference
between a cat and a lion; you must forgive
him.'</p>

<p>"I said to myself, 'If the Moslem is a fool, the
Christian is wise, and can see through a turban.'
Then the merchant took me into a beautiful room, with
windows of glass, and tables of precious wood covered
with china and crystal; and round the walls were mirrors,
and pictures of houris, and everything fit for a
Sultan; and I said to myself, 'O Ayoub! hast thou not
found the palace of Alla ed Din?' After I had looked
about a little, the merchant told me to sit, and brought
me a small table, with a back made of cane, and a bar
for the feet; with such a turban on, what could I do?
I sat down on it, and found it was a just fit, neither too
small, nor too large, and I was afraid to move for fear
of falling, so I put my hands down under my hayk,
and held on by the sides of the chair. I began to think
I was a 'father of the ears,' passing myself for what I
was not, and I doubted but the infidel thought so too;
but I forgive him for laughing at my beard, for the
lesson he taught me, as I had told him I was one of the
palace guards from Marocco.</p>

<p>"While I was thus perched, like a water-melon on
a plate, the merchant brought out a handsome gun,
inlaid with silver and ivory, and gave it me to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
at. My Arab blood could never resist a horse or a gun;
off my guard, I stretched out my hand to take it, lost
my balance, and down I came. The merchant sprang
forward and saved my fall.</p>

<p>"'You have more cushions than chairs in the
palace,' said he, 'but sit down on the carpet, and here
are cushions.'</p>

<p>"I took his advice and sat down, praying that the
inventor of such seats might be condemned to sit on one
on the top of the highest mosque in the town, until
I took him down. Well, presently came in another
young infidel, with blue eyes, and the two began
chirruping away like squirrels, then they gave me tea
flavoured with ambergris, cakes, and hallows. When
I had eaten God's blessings until I was ashamed, they
brought me a little black box; and when I had it in my
hand, one of them touched a nail, and (may I be protected!)
it began to speak, when I threw it on the carpet,
and jumping up, shook my clothes, and invoked curses
on Satan, while the two unbelievers were rolling with
laughter. I was about to escape, when they got up
and begged me to stop, telling me it was only done by
art, and not by magic. Then they made it begin again,
and lo! as I listened, it warbled beautiful music, a
hundred times more sweet than the song of the Oom el
hassn or Zurzur. I sat with my hands upraised and
my mouth open, exclaiming 'Adjaib! Wonderful!
Wonderful! God is great!' Then it stopped, and behold,
I was still in this world! 'O merchant! God
increase your blessings,' said I; 'there is only one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
you Christians cannot do, for you can do everything
else.'</p>

<p>"'What is that?' said he.</p>

<p>"'O merchant, you cannot prevent death!'</p>

<p>"'We do not wish it, O Sheik; if we do not die,
we do not go to heaven.'</p>

<p>"This made me stare: the infidel to go to Jinnah!
with the true believer?</p>

<p>"'Would it not be better,' said I, 'to enjoy God's
blessings in this world as long as we can, in case of
missing the road to the other?'</p>

<p>"'God is merciful,' said he; so not wishing to hurt
his feelings, I thought of the pig, and said nothing."</p>

<p>Yusuf, however, thought it as well to put in a word
for infidels in general. "Yes," said he, "O Sheik!
God is merciful, and is it not written in the gloss of the
great Saint Abd el Kader Jilelly, 'Behold three sit
at the gate of Paradise, Sidna (our lord) Mohammed,
Sidna Moosa, and Sidna Aisa, and when one cometh
and it is asked of him, 'What art thou?' he answereth,
'I am a Moslem,' and behold Sidna Mohammed
openeth the gate and saith, 'Enter.' And
another cometh and saith, 'I am a Jew,' and Sidna
Moosa openeth the gate and saith, 'Enter.' And
another cometh and saith, 'I am a Christian,' and
Sidna Aisa openeth the gate and saith, 'Enter.' And
a fourth cometh and saith, 'I am a Renegade, I have
changed my faith,' so no one openeth unto him, he is
accursed!"</p>

<p>"Did our lord, Abd el Kader write that?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Ayoub, "wonderful is the mercy of God; but no doubt,
in his days, Christians did not eat pig. But where
was I? I remember. Well, then, the young infidel
with blue eyes took me by the sleeve, and said, 'Come
with me, and I will show you <i>such</i> a horse as you
have not seen in the Sultan's stud;' what could I do?
I followed him with alacrity, so we went down into the
court-yard, and oh, what a horse! I would walk three
days' journey on foot to see such another; his coat was
mottled like the ripple of the stream, his neck like a
rainbow, his mane, like a curtain of silk, reached to his
knees, eyes and legs like the antelope, and broad
breasted like a houri; what can I say? I sat down by
the wall and blessed him. He was as quiet as a lamb,
but when the Christian mounted him he became like a
lion, his eye saw everything, his ear heard everything,
his hoof disdained everything, and as he paced along,
I could have thrown myself under his feet, and let
him walk over me.</p>

<p>"'You are a judge of horses,' said the merchant,
'what do you think of him?'</p>

<p>"'May evil eyes be averted from him,' said I, 'he
is perfect.'</p>

<p>"And when I got on the subject (although not given
to talking) I ran on about shoulders and pasterns,
fetlocks and hoofs, manes and tails, eyes, nostrils, and
genealogies, enough to fill a book, till the merchant
was astonished, and must have thought I was a
delal.</p>

<p>"'You have seen horses, O Sheik!' said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
'but you have not learnt that it is safer to ride a
horse that kicks than one you don't know.'</p>

<p>"I saw I was fairly found out, and was obliged to
give up the game.</p>

<p>"'I have learnt, O merchant!' said I, 'that the
eagle cannot fly with the wings of the ostrich; and if
I had not been fool enough to curl my moustachios in
a Ka&iuml;d's skin, I should not have deserved to have the
beard of my father's son laughed at; Sheik Ayoub
Seba&iuml;e is not ashamed of his tribe, but in truth these
Moors always measure a man by the size of his turban,
and I thought you would do the same. Allaw
Ackbar! what can I say more?'</p>

<p>"'Although I am a merchant,' said he, 'I don't
measure a man with a cloth cubit; come to-morrow
in your own dress and I'll show you more, that you
have not seen. It is a little at a time, that the sheep
gets into the stew-pan.'</p>

<p>"I found that out in time, and by degrees I got
accustomed to that dress, and a dozen others, so that
none could tell that I had not been born in them.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you another time how I escaped from the
town of Teradant with the Ka&iuml;d's horse. But to go
back to the merchant, I went the next day dressed
as I am now.</p>

<p>"'God be praised, Sheik Ayoub!' said he, 'now
you are a true son of the Desert, we shall be better
friends.' (The slipper-counter did not stop me this
time.)</p>

<p>"He brought me to a sofa, and we ate and drank, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
praised God; and were as if we had been brought up
in the same tent."</p>

<p>"And the pig! you did not eat that?" said
Yusuf, laughing.</p>

<p>"God forbid!" said Ayoub, spitting on the ground.
"I took an oath of him before eating that there was
none in the food; besides he had a Moslem for a cook,
and you know he would not touch it. Afterwards, he
took me on board his ship, and showed me wonderful
things, clocks, and watches, and guns without flints
that never missed; matches to light without fire,
pictures and astrolabes, and all sorts of wonderful
things, till I got giddy with the motion of the ship,
and we landed in a boat; I used to go to his house
every day, and when I had sold my ostrich-feathers
and gum from Soudan, and my camels were rested,
and I was about to depart, I thought he would
have shed tears; he gave me presents of gunpowder,
and a cloth dress of blue, and fine tea, and this pair
of pistols; and then he rode on the way with me, two
hours' journey. Then he said, 'God be with thee, oh, my
brother! and bring thee to thy tents in peace. And
now, I beseech thee, if peradventure any of my countrymen
should be shipwrecked on the Desert, or fall
into the hands of thy people, that thou wilt be kind
to them, and befriend them for my sake.' I promised
by the bread and salt that was between us, and
we parted, and both went on our way sorrowful.
How often I remember him, and pray that his house
may be prosperous, and that he may be enlightened!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Ayoub rested his chin in his hand in a fit of
abstraction, and to recover his breath.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" he muttered, "yes, God is great.
The English are good, the English are to be trusted;
are they not sons of Sultans, oh, why do they eat
pig? But now I remember, my friend, the merchant
told me he never ate pig, and his cook a Moslem, I
don't believe he ever did eat pig, Al hamdo l'Illah, I
am sure the friend of Sheik Ayoub never ate pig! Alla
Illah!"</p>

<p>"Now tell me," said Yusuf, "where we halt to-night,
for we appear to be going the road I came?"</p>

<p>"True," said Ayoub, "we stop at the wells where
the Cafila was plundered. That was a clever foray of
Ali el Bezz, he brought in a fine booty without any
loss; I wish he were with us, for, excepting Sidi
Hamed, there is not a better head, or a surer hand
on an expedition, between this and El Yemen."</p>

<p>The sun was casting its level rays against the
Eastern sky when they reached the rocks, the scene
of the late attack. Here they all bivouacked under
the spangled canopy; there were two or three tents
for the chief and some of the sheiks; of these one
was allotted to Yusuf and his escort. After the
horses were watered and picketed, Ayoub was sent
for to the chief's tent, and returned with an Arab,
carrying jars of milk, butter, dates, barley-cakes, and
dried ostrich flesh, in strips.</p>

<p>"The chief sends you this poor supper," said
Ayoub; "I told him flesh was not lawful for you if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you did not kill it; so here are two fowls, you kill
them according to your custom, and they are lawful
to us; my uncle's son here will cook them; we mount
with the moon's rising."</p>

<p>The night was calm, and the fires were beginning
to blaze around as the Arabs collected in groups to
cook their evening meal. Beyond the hum of a multitude
there was very little noise, and as Yusuf and
his host sat by their fire, in front of their tent, Yusuf
reminded him of his promise to recount his adventures
in Teradant.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sheik!" he said, "your adventures are like
the Thousand and One Nights, when a man has heard
one, lo, he asks for another."</p>

<p>"Bismillah!" said Ayoub, nothing loth to recount
his exploits. "As you say I have seen things; let me
recollect, it was when I was employed with the men
of my tribe plundering the caravans and traders that
frequented the market of Teradant with produce and
merchandise; for all who did not pay us toll were not
spared; have we not a right to custom from goods
passing our territories as well as the Sultan? and those
who did not pay for protection made no profit by
their ventures. So, you see, I had friends in the town
who protected me for a share of the booty, and who
would not have been long on God's earth had they
dared to betray us; thus, O friend, I was in the habit
of entering the town in disguise to obtain intelligence
of the movements of the merchants. One of our
friends kept a kebab-shop, where the sons of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
collected of an evening to eat kebabs, and drink sherbet,
and hear the news; he made his force-meat of
sheep's heads, and these when clean boiled were piled
up at the end of the room. I have seen there several
thousands; we formed a recess behind these with
boards, communicating with the back room by a
small door; and here have I often been cooped up
watching the guests, and hearing all their plans and
the value of their goods when they little thought the
sheep's skulls had eyes in them. Another was a grain-merchant,
and there I have been buried in barley up to
my neck, with a fanega measure with a hole in it
over my head, and heard who was going with money
to the douars to buy grain. And, behold, were they
not astonished when Sheik Ayoub met them on the
Sahel with the salutation of peace, and asked one for
the twenty pieces of gold that were in his camel's
saddle, and another for the three hundred ducats sewn
up in the right sleeve of his djilabea?</p>

<p>"One day riding with some of my band, a few
miles from the town, I met a horseman in a fine hayk,
and green velvet coat.</p>

<p>"'Peace to you, O Abdallah,' said I, 'where is my
lord going?'</p>

<p>"'To you, peace,' said he; 'I go to the douar to
buy a sheep.'</p>

<p>"'Has my lord a pass from Sheik Ayoub?'
said I.</p>

<p>"'Am I a trader to need a pass?' said he; 'I am a
poor man.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"'God is merciful, O Sheik!' said I; 'as you are
a poor man I will only take your nose-bag.'</p>

<p>"'The nose-bag of my horse!' said he, turning
pale; 'know you not that it is unlucky to part with
that? I will redeem it; behold three dirhems, the
price of the sheep, take them.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said I; 'I must have the nose-bag.'</p>

<p>"'I will give you the hayk,' said he, 'or my
caftan of cloth, for I fear ill-luck to my horse.'</p>

<p>"'No, by Allah!' said I; 'I will not plunder a
poor man, nothing but the nose-bag: have I not
sworn?' and I hooked it from his pommel with the
end of my gun. 'And now, Sheik Abdallah,' said I,
'follow me, your nose-bag shall be restored, and no
harm shall befall your horse.' Then his face brightened,
and he followed me joyfully. When we came to
a place among the trees where there was a surface of
smooth sand, I dismounted my men, and the horses
being all tied up, I traced a circle on the sand, and
made the men all sit around, and thus I addressed the
unfortunate one:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You wonder, perhaps, why I would only take
from you your nose-bag&mdash;but know, O Sheik Abdallah,
that I am a man of a charitable disposition,
but possessed of no property except a ring, which
once belonged to Allah ed Deen; and as I was
desirous of repairing the sanctuary of our patron
saint, and building a fountain for wayfarers, I rubbed
the ring, when, lo, one of the jinn, the slave of the
ring, appeared, and stood before me with his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
crossed on his breast, and his eyes looking on the
ground, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I hear and obey.'</p>

<p>"Then I said, 'I have need of fifty pieces of
gold.'</p>

<p>"And he said, 'On the head and eyes;' and he
disappeared for the space that a feather might fall to
the ground, and came back, saying, 'There is not a
piece of gold in the treasure-house of the jinn.'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'Woe unto thee.'</p>

<p>"But he said, 'Let not my lord be wroth, there
is a remedy; let my lord ride in the morning towards
Teradant, and there shall meet him a man of a handsome
countenance wearing a green caftan, embroidered
with gold, and a filelly hayk, you will take from him
nothing but the nose-bag of his horse, and having put
therein the ring, you will make a circle on the ground,
and lay it in the midst, covering it with a hayk, and
peradventure my lord's wishes will be accomplished.'</p>

<p>"My friend of the fine coat looked like the man
who is going to the bastinado, whilst I made my preparations.
Then I sat down within the circle, and
put my hands under the hayk, and when I withdrew
my hand, lo, a piece of gold! and again I put in my
hand, and lo, another piece of gold! And the eyes of
my Arabs were rounded, and their mouths open, and
they felt the pieces of gold to see if they were real,
and behold, they were bintekas of fine gold, and I
ceased not to count until I had counted fifty pieces of
gold! Then I arose, and said, 'The jinn has accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
my desire, and now, O Sheik, I give thee a
pe&ccedil;eta of five dirhems for the use of thy nose-bag,
take it, and go in peace, lest ill-luck befall thy horse.'
And the Moor's face was white, and his features
trembled, as though he had seen an Afreet, but my
face was as a deep well. Then he mused a little, and
said, 'O Sheik! the slave of the ring is no other than
a woman. A woman betrayed our father Adam, on
whom be peace; and woman betrayed Suleiman the
wise; and who are we that we should escape?' so he
mounted his horse and departed."</p>

<p>"And was he right in his guess, O Sheik?" said
Yusuf.</p>

<p>"He was, and he was not," said Ayoub. "I will
tell you how it happened; Sheik Abdallah is a relation
of the Ka&iuml;d of Teradant, and I had found out that he
was about to depart on a trading expedition to purchase
gum and ostrich-feathers; and as he was going alone,
and taking no goods with him for barter, I knew he
must have sent money before, or would carry it with
him; he lived not far from the kebab-shop, and the
houses of Teradant being all flat-roofed, and the partition
walls low, I have frequently walked all over the
town at night on the roofs. So one dark night I went
to the top of his house, and sat down, overlooking the
room where he was, on the opposite side of the court;
it was hot, and he was sitting in the gallery outside
with his wife. There was a great deal talked that did
not concern me; at last his wife said, 'O my lord,
when do you go to Tafilelt?' and he answered, 'On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
such a day.' Then she caressed him and said, 'The
veils of Tafilelt are as fine muslins of Ind; will not my
lord buy one for his slave, that she may appear honourable
in the eyes of the women that go to the baths,
and they will say, "Behold, this is the wife of Abdallah
the merchant!"'</p>

<p>"'O light of my eyes!' said he, 'have I any
money to buy filelly hayks, or fine clothes? I have
none.'</p>

<p>"'False!' said she, 'are there not fifty pieces of
gold that my lord ordered me to sew into his horse's
nose-bag?'</p>

<p>"Then he smote her on the mouth with his slipper,
and said, 'Peace, O unlucky! lest some of the slaves
hear thee. Is that money mine? is it not to pay for
merchandise which I owe?'</p>

<p>"Well, as I had heard all I wanted to know, I
left them to make up their quarrel, and that is how
the woman was the slave of the ring. Abdallah the
Moor, enraged by the loss of his money, complained
to the Governor; and a stricter watch than ever was
kept to take me, and even a reward of one hundred
dirhems was proclaimed by the public crier, to any
one who would bring me bound before the Ka&iuml;d.
Well, I laughed at all this, till one unlucky morning
I was going into the town, disguised as a Berebber
peasant, driving a donkey laden with firewood; and
as other cattle were going in and coming out, there
was a crush, and I got enraged, and cursed, forgetting
to change my voice; and, behold, when I looked up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Abdallah the Moor, sitting on his horse, waiting to
go forth, and his eyes were fixed on me like two coals
in white rings. I had on a tattered cloak, with a
hood. I saw that he knew me, though he said
nothing, and I passed on, and went to my friend the
cook's shop. Whilst I was debating about leaving
the town, my friend came to me with evil tidings:
'Knowest thou, Sheik Ayoub,' said he, 'that thou
hast been recognised by some one, and search is made
everywhere to take thee. The gates of the town are
closed, and guards set on the walls to prevent thy
escape.'</p>

<p>"'God is great,' said I; 'was a panther or a bird
ever kept in a cage without a roof? May the Ka&iuml;d's
beard be defiled! probably to-morrow, or the day
after, they will open the gates.'</p>

<p>"'This time,' said he, 'you are in danger. What
had you to do to meddle with the Ka&iuml;d or his relations?
he is furious and vows vengeance against any one that
hides you; but we have eaten bread and salt together.'</p>

<p>"'God be praised!' said I, 'and we have eaten
the money of the Sultan's subjects together; and,
moreover, is it not known that the man who should
betray Sheik Ayoub Seba&iuml;e, he and his family would
be made into kebabs, and roasted in the flames of his
own house?'</p>

<p>"'May evil eyes be averted!' said he, 'but know
further that the Ka&iuml;d has taken up his residence in
the kiosk over the gate, and none can go out without
a pass from him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Has he so?' said I, as a thought struck me.
'God is merciful! then I will go out by that gate.
If it is written, he may repent of bringing the lion to
bay.'</p>

<p>"I knew that the Ka&iuml;d had a son, a boy of six years
old, of whom he was very fond, and from whom he
never separated; and if I could find them alone, my
escape was secure, and the Ka&iuml;d's beard would be defiled.</p>

<p>"I remained hidden that day, and the next, hearing
the search that was being made for me; and the next
evening, having received intelligence that the people
had dispersed from the audience, and that the Governor
was alone in the kiosk; about an hour before the
evening prayer I sallied out dressed as a Moor of the
town, and reached the gate without interruption, but
in dread lest some of the soldiers lounging about might
recognise me. I sent one of the guards with a message
to the Ka&iuml;d, to say that I wished to give information
regarding Sheik Ayoub, and wanted a private interview.
He soon returned, and I followed him to the presence
of the Ka&iuml;d. The latter was sitting on his mattress
and cushions, with his little boy by his side; he had
a chess-board and ivory pieces, and was trying to teach
the game to the child; he was so pre-occupied that
he just looked up when I entered, and made a motion
for me to sit, which I did.</p>

<p>"'Father,' said the child, 'what is the use of the
Roh?'</p>

<p>"'To protect the Sultan when in danger, my dear
boy.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And so,' said he, without taking his attention
from the board, 'you have brought intelligence of
Ayoub El Rami; if you can help me catch him, I will
change his name to El Eshara' (the mark).</p>

<p>"'There!'&mdash;here he castled the king&mdash;'now the
Shah is safe.'</p>

<p>"'And if the Shah can't move,' suggested the
child, while I had uncovered my head, and freed my
hands for action.</p>

<p>"I could not help smiling at the security of the
two, near one whom the Ka&iuml;d might suppose his
greatest enemy.</p>

<p>"'God be praised!' said the Ka&iuml;d, delighted at
the precociousness of his pet, 'you will soon be a
master. If the Shah can't escape, it is Shah M&#257;t.'</p>

<p>"'But what have you, friend, to say to me? Where
is this Shietan Ayoub to be found?' Here he looked
round, and found my eyes fixed upon him, when it
was amusing to see the change that came over his
features, and his terror at finding himself in such
dangerous company. I was tempted to echo his
'Shah M&#257;t.'</p>

<p>"'You require information, O Ka&iuml;d,' I said, 'respecting
Ayoub Ibn Yarib Seba&iuml;e, and I knew of no
one more able to give it than <i>himself</i>; he expected a
more courteous reception than you lately promised
him, but having no desire to be your target, he intends
to leave this place unharmed.' Seeing me so quiet,
his terror subsided, and he thought to intrap me by
cunning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"'By the beard of the Prophet!' said he, 'I did
not believe all these accusations against you; I intend
you no evil, I will give orders that you be not molested,
you may depart in peace.'</p>

<p>"'Is Sheik Ayoub a father of the ears?' said I;
'he is come to claim the reward, and cannot leave my
lord's roof empty-handed.'</p>

<p>"'Who are we,' said the Ka&iuml;d, beginning to chafe,
'that your father's son should dare to come and spit on
the beard of the Sultan's Khalifa?'</p>

<p>"I had played the fool long enough, and, seeing he
was about to summon assistance, I suddenly seized his
arm, and placed a pistol to his breast.</p>

<p>"'Mark me,' said I, 'the first call for help sends
a ball through your body;' and I swore an irrevocable
oath. 'And now listen: I intend to leave this
town by the gate, and in safety; and to ensure this, I
take your child as a hostage. If I am not molested
I will return him in safety, but should I be pursued&mdash;'
here I whispered in his ear, 'By Allah, he dies!
Now you are in my power, and let your head teach
you wisdom.'</p>

<p>"The Ka&iuml;d, seeing my determination, thought it
better to submit; fortunately the child, who was a little
frightened at first, was docile; and when his father
reluctantly resigned him, unconscious of his danger, he
let me take him in my arms, thinking he was only
going for a ride, and coming back. I then went to the
door and called out, 'Who waits?'</p>

<p>"'Your slave,' answered the guard from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The Governor commands you to bring his horse
caparisoned to the gate, and his gun.&mdash;Away! delay
not!'</p>

<p>"'On my head and eyes be it,' said the soldier.</p>

<p>"As the horses were always kept ready saddled, I
had not long to wait. I could not help feeling for the
old man, notwithstanding his ill-will. When I was
about to take away his boy, he would have bound himself
by any oath, rather than expose him to this peril,
but I dared not trust him. I took him to the balcony
overlooking the plain, 'You sought my life,' I said,
'but you are forgiven; and may you behave to me and
mine, should we fall into your power, as I behave to
this child. Now behold the sanctuary on the top of
the nearest hill, when I reach that in peace I will
deliver the boy to the Marabt who keeps it; but,
should you rashly pursue me, his blood be on your
own head, my hands are clean.'</p>

<p>"It is painful to see a man accustomed to command
eat the bitter apple of humiliation. I had brought him
so low that I could almost have trusted him, when the
tears were in his eyes, as he kissed his child, entreating
me to be cool, and not influenced by any false alarm
or appearance of danger.</p>

<p>"'Allah! Allah!' he cried in anguish, 'if I lose my
child, my power will have cost me dear. May your
journey be prosperous!' Then calling the soldier he
said, 'Go with my friend to the gate; he is going to
the sanctuary to pray for my son; let no man stay him,
you have heard.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went down with the child in my arms, and mounting
the horse, a noble animal he was, and taking the
gun, which was also very valuable, across the pommel,
I rode deliberately out of the town, congratulating
myself on the success of my stratagem. The saint's
tomb was about two miles from the gates, and I considered
that quite a sufficient start in case of pursuit.
As I rode slowly across the plain, I could see the
Governor walking up and down his balcony, and wishing
to give him a severe lesson, knowing he was
watching my movements, I purposely stopped to speak
to every horseman I met on the road. At one time
two horsemen came galloping at full speed from the
direction of the town,&mdash;they were only exercising; but
as I turned my horse's head towards them, I could
plainly see the old man wringing his hands in painful
suspense; and as they came near me, he sat down and
hid his face in his hayk, whilst the child was prattling
away, and in the highest delight at his excursion.
And that is how Sheik Ayoub escaped from the town
with the horse of the Ka&iuml;d Abdallah Ibn Sadek; and
now it is time to sleep, for we start with the dawn."</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>AZORA.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/003.png" width="70" height="70" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">he</span> time allowed to Azora to give a definite
answer to the Sultan's proposal had quickly
passed away. She had not been allowed much
time for preparation for the awful fate that menaced
her in case of non-compliance, on account of the
intrusive officiousness of the inmates of the hareem,
who with childish kindness did all in their power to
alleviate her distress, which they attributed to her regret
at leaving her relations and friends; never for a moment
imagining that she could have courage to relinquish
the pleasures of life, and brave death in its most revolting
shape, when it might be avoided by what appeared
to them so slight a sacrifice; and they already looked
upon her as a future companion. Some of the ladies
of the hareem had handsome features which the absence
of expression rendered valueless. They were the fair
faces of women who are born, brought up, and die with
scarcely (except in very childhood) any communication
with their kind,&mdash;whose whole world from birth to death
is comprised within three or four rooms with blank
walls. This sedentary existence is conducive to the
obesity, which to Moorish taste is considered the perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of female beauty; and the women adopt every
means to encourage this natural tendency; one of these
is the same as the plan adopted with us for fattening
turkeys. A paste composed of new bread and oleaginous
seeds, is formed into balls, the size of a pigeon's
egg, and a certain number of these are swallowed
whole, washed down with water; this is done daily until
the required standard of deformity is reached. The
inmates of the Sultan's hareem had the advantage of
gardens, into which their rooms opened. These gardens
were planted with fruit-trees and vines on trellis;
and in the centre of the one they now looked on, was
a basin and fountain, that threw its spray on high and
cooled the air, confined as it was within high walls.
One of the ladies was about Azora's own age, and had
become very much attached to her, she had claims to
beauty of face and form, which the fattening process,
at her age, had not yet destroyed. Her black hair was
ornamented with pearls and beads of fine gold; her
flashing eye was brightened by the kohal, with which
her lids were tinged; a latent smile played round a
mouth which should have been lovely; she was a
creature of mere life with no thought but for such
trivial happiness as she might snatch in her contracted
sphere on earth, and for anything beyond, probably
never thought of it at all! She wore an embroidered
green velvet jacket, fitted to the form, and flowing
muslin trousers, over this dress was wound a fine hayk.
Her name was Oom-el-Zin. While some of them were
swallowing balls, and others staining their feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hands in patterns with henna, or employed in other
ways, Azora and her friend wandered out, following
one of the grape-walks, till they came to a secluded
bower formed by the foliage, and furnished with carpets
and cushions. Here they sat down.</p>

<p>"This day will seal my fate, O my sister!" said
Azora, mournfully. Her friend said nothing in reply,
but her habitual smile forsook her now sorrowful face,
and tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why are you so kind to me?" Azora continued,
embracing her. "To part from you will more embitter
the cup that I must drink."</p>

<p>"Oh, say not you will leave me," said Oom-el-Zin,
throwing her arms around Azora, "you make me
shudder when you talk of death, and yet I begin to
believe you are in earnest. But no! you can not&mdash;you
dare not&mdash;die!"</p>

<p>"The God of Israel will support me in death," said
Azora, solemnly. "A few short years, and who, of all
those who now behold my doom, will be alive to tell
how died the Hebrew girl?&mdash;and shall I barter an
eternity, compared to which centuries are but as those
glittering drops of water to the firmament they mock,
for power to drag out my few remaining years in guilt
and infamy? What can I not dare for the love of
God, to whom I owe all? and when His hand is heavy
upon me, shall I not say, with the Arabian patriarch&mdash;'The
Lord hath given&mdash;the Lord hath taken&mdash;blessed
be the Lord.'"</p>

<p>"Talk not so, O dear, dear Azora! I would rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
live out my life in a prison, without the light of day,
only I would not die. Oh, we will be so happy here
together! Oh, you cannot sacrifice yourself&mdash;you, so
young, so beautiful; you make me so miserable. Oh,
live! and stay with us." But in vain the tearful eye
of the affectionate girl looked for a kindred feeling in
the face of the enthusiastic Jewess.</p>

<p>"Alas! for you, my dear girl," she said; "did
you possess the hope of a glorious future, you would
not dread that which must, sooner or later, come to
all.&mdash;But lo! we are called. The hour is come."</p>

<p>They arose to return, as one of the women attendants
had come to summon Azora to the Sultan's presence.</p>

<p>"I almost distrust my own weak heart," she continued;
"but the Lord of Hosts is my strength, the
God of Israel is my refuge."</p>

<p>Tenderly embracing her weeping and disconsolate
companion, she accompanied the messenger, and was
conducted to the same apartment that had been the
scene of her previous trial.</p>

<p>The short period that had intervened&mdash;but which to
her had been an age of mental suffering&mdash;showed its
influence on her frame; her pale cheeks witnessed to
the anguish that had preyed on her soul; but now they
flushed with a hectic glow, from the strong temporary
excitement of her position, and her beauty was not the
less transcendent.</p>

<p>The Sultan was reclining on the cushions when she
entered, but rose to meet her.</p>

<p>"Welcome, O beautiful one!" said he; "how long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to me has been the time, deprived of your presence!
If it has changed your resolution, I am content. Come
you now to enjoy with me life, happiness, and triumph,
or&mdash;" His brow darkened as she stood silent and
motionless, and he could perceive no signs of acquiescence.
There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Finish, O my lord!" said Azora, at length, "'or
death,' you would say,&mdash;God's will be done!&mdash;Yet, O
my lord!" and she threw herself at his feet, "pause
ere you pronounce my doom. Oh, throw not away
the high privilege of mercy. If in truth you loved me,
could your tongue consign me to death? Impossible!
To torture? Oh, the thought is horrible! Save me!
O king, save me! though not for my sake, for your
own, for the sake of your undying fame. Oh, will you
for a caprice forego the satisfaction of doing a noble
deed, and tarnish with blood the annals of a beneficent
reign? What will be said among the nations when it
is known that the Sultan Mulai Abd Er Rahman has shed
the innocent blood of a woman? Oh, be merciful, and
spare me!"</p>

<p>The Sultan was moved by this appeal, seconded by
her imploring action and anguished face, but was too
intent on his purpose to give way to more than a passing
emotion.</p>

<p>"Arise," he said, "why kneel to me; are you not
the arbitress of your own fate? 'Tis I that implore
you to save yourself and have pity on me. That I wish
not your death, which is forfeit to the law, witness my
patience, and the efforts I have made to change your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
mad resolve. But that I love you, rather would I see
you die, than given to the arms of another. What!
shall I see a vile slave possess that which his sovereign
sued for in vain? But what is this strange infatuation?
Oh, change but your faith, and I will raise you from
your base state, exposed to insult and persecution, to
be the favourite of a Sultan, with slaves to obey your
every wish&mdash;power to protect your friends&mdash;in short,
all, all that a king can offer, shall be yours! Why will
you thus madly persist in throwing away your life?
Speak but the word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All this, O my lord," said Azora, firmly, "shall
not bribe me to betray my God; I ask mercy, but I
ask it unconditionally. What law have I broken?
what crime have I committed, for which to sue for
pardon? yet the mercy you offer is more cruel than
your unjust sentence of death! Were you a just
king, my false accusers&mdash;for you know them false&mdash;would
ere this have paid the penalty of their perjury.
I am in your power, and may God help me! I will
endure all you can inflict rather than save my innocent
life by a dishonourable and criminal compromise. But
oh, how shall this black deed sully the brightness of
your reign to all posterity! We shall meet again before
the tribunal of the Lord of kings, and before
whom Sultans will tremble."</p>

<p>She had drawn herself up to her full height while
thus speaking, and her bosom heaving, and her eyes
flashing with enthusiasm, she stood like an inspired
prophetess, but with a martyr's calm resolve. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Sultan had thus far endeavoured to stifle his feelings,
but now his rage became ungovernable.</p>

<p>"It is thus, then, that you defy me," he said:
"now hear the alternative. If the thought is dreadful,
how will you bear the reality? How will you bear to
be the gaze and scoff of a ruffian rabble&mdash;to be stripped
by the rude hands of the executioner? How will your
delicate frame bear the agony when thrown alive into
the burning pile? Then, when the hot fire slowly
seizes on each writhing limb, and every scorched nerve
overwhelms your soul with agonising torments, then&mdash;when
too late, you will repent your refusal of my
proffered mercy. Then&mdash;when too late, you will wish
to recall this lost opportunity, and your tender limbs
will fall a lifeless corse among the smouldering ashes.
This is your doom! I have said!"</p>

<p>With his face and frame agitated by his passion,
and casting a malignant look on the lovely but trembling
girl, he rushed from the apartment. Azora's
heart sickened within her, as she listened, with suspended
breath, to the description of the torture that
awaited her. It was a fearful trial, and she had well-nigh
sunk under it. Finding herself alone, her firmness
forsook her; she threw herself on the cushions,
and burst into an agony of tears, and convulsive sobs
shook her frame; but this was a luxury, compared
to the horrible feeling that came over her, when, after
a time, she raised her deadly pale face, from which all
traces of tears had passed away, and remained with her
eyes fixed on vacancy, while an icy chill seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
curdle her heart's blood, and a tightness in the throat
oppressed her almost to suffocation, as she realized the
appalling picture of an ignominious death thus presented
to her as the alternative of her resistance. Was
it surprising that, at such a trying moment, her existence
suspended trembling on the verge of the tomb,
and failing nature standing terror-struck on the brink
of the awful abyss that separated her from eternity,&mdash;she,
so young, should shrink from taking the fatal
plunge. Already was she beginning to parley with
conscience,&mdash;already was her resolution wavering, and
the bright crown of martyrdom, which seemed on the
point of encircling her brow, was ascending from whence
it was offered, as the love of life, and the enjoyments
of the world, were resuming their dominion over her
young heart, when, suddenly, overcoming herself with
an almost supernatural effort, she fell on her knees,
and poured out her anguished soul before God, imploring
Him to take the love of the world from her
heart, and strengthen her to support the trials that
awaited her for her attachment to her faith. The
struggle was past, her prayer was heard. She arose
from her knees, a radiant smile lighting up her angel
face, and she could now calmly contemplate death, as
a passage from her sufferings here to everlasting life in
the presence of her Redeemer.</p>

<p>A stranger, unacquainted with the peculiar character
and customs of this people, might naturally be disposed
to ask, why the Sultan should be so scrupulous
in his conduct towards a Jewess, of a race, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
described to be in a state of semi-servitude. It was
exactly in the fact of her being a Jewess, that the
obstacles the Sultan had to contend with lay.</p>

<p>If it had been possible that a Moorish woman
could have made an objection to becoming a Sultana,
the same compulsion would have been used, as is used
in two-thirds of the marriages among them, in which
the parties have no previous knowledge of each other.
Moorish women are only too ready to become inmates
of the Sultan's hareem. But in the case of a Jewess, of
a despised religion, the Sultan dare not avow his real
object. To have taken Azora, as a Jewess, would have
raised a fanatical insurrection. There is, moreover,
among the higher classes of the Moors, much of that
chivalric spirit which distinguished them in Spain, if,
indeed, it is not of Arabian origin, and which invested
woman with a sacred character,&mdash;indeed the very word
hareem implies sanctity. Again, it is the policy of the
Sultan to encourage the Jews, who alone of his subjects
engage in foreign commerce, from which he derives the
greater part of his revenue, and his only hold on them
consists in the protection afforded to their religion.
Interfere with their observances deliberately, and he is
apprehensive of their abandoning these pursuits, and
endeavouring to remove their wealth from the country.
So long as Azora asserted her Jewish faith, he might
take her life, but she was in no danger of any other
indignity; and it is probably owing to the unswerving
attachment of the Jews to their faith, even to martyrdom,
and its consequent want of success, that this false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
accusation is so rarely resorted to. The enraged despot,
incapable of admiring the heroic fortitude of his helpless
captive, was incensed beyond measure by the
failure of all his attempts to intimidate, or persuade her
into compliance. Vacillating between his passion and
his fears, he was tempted to violate the commands of the
Koran, which forbids a Moslem to marry an infidel;
deterred, on the other hand, by the danger of the experiment,
especially at the present juncture, when the
principal Arab chiefs were in rebellion, and it behoved
him to secure the fidelity of his troops, whose attachment
might be entirely alienated by any sacrilegious
breach of the laws of religion. As a last resource, he
determined to put in execution a plan he had often
thought of in his moments of rage and disappointment.
He resolved to expose her to the wild beasts, of which
there were several in his menagerie; he doubted not
that her terror would then overcome what he considered
her obstinacy, and should this fail, her death was
decreed. Among the wild beasts was a magnificent
lion, this animal was comparatively tame, being kept
well fed, and under his keeper's control. Trusting to
his docility, the keeper had ventured to lead him about
the town by a rope, he had on one occasion destroyed
a child, and on another struck down and killed an unfortunate
donkey with one blow of his enormous paw,
by way of practice, and to show what he could do. It
was to this enormous brute, that the lovely and fragile
girl was to be exposed, and the Sultan could hardly
believe that she would not at once embrace the Koran,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to escape the horrible fate of being torn to pieces.
Moody and slow he took his way to the M'Shouar, and
ordered the keeper to attend and receive his commands.
Here he found the principal Wezeer, Talb Jelool, who,
after the usual obeisance, informed him that he had
matters of importance to communicate. The Sultan
took his seat, and gave his acquiescence with an emphatic
"Bism' Illah." And the Wezeer producing his
papers, sat at the foot of the carpet, and, waving his
hand to the attendants, they immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>"May my lord's throne be exalted!" he said. "I
have heard that the Arabs are marching northward;
they have already passed through Suse and Draha, and
menace the province of Rahamna; and behold here is
a letter from the Ka&iuml;d of Teradant, which I will read
to my lord the Sultan.</p>

<p>"'Praise be to the one God. To the great and
mighty lord, the Khalifa of the Prophet, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
Mulai Abd Er Rahman, from his slave Abdallah Ibn
Sadek, governor of Teradant. Be it known to my lord,
that his rebel slave, Hamed Ibn Ishem, at the head of
the tribes of Abu Sebah, Tuwat, Al Harib, and others,
amounting to about ten thousand Arabs, have entered
and overrun the province of Suse, carrying off flocks
and camels, and levying tribute in the realm of our
sovereign lord. Having only fifty horsemen, besides
the militia of the town, my lord's servant was unable
to take the field, against such large forces, and would
humbly urge the necessity of sending a body of the
black troops to stop their further depredations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
protect this town, the walls of which are not strong
enough to keep the enemy out, should they attack it.
Peace! This 10th day of Saffer, 1248.'"</p>

<p>The Sultan could hardly keep patience during the
perusal of this letter. "And has the slave dared,"
said he, "to attack our territories, as well as refuse us
tribute? By the holy Prophet's tomb, the death of
every dog of his tribe would ill atone for such an
insult. Summon the Berebber tribes of the mountains.
Send troops to the assistance of the Ka&iuml;d of Teradant!
And as soon as we are in a position to take the field,
we will scatter their hordes, and drive the remnants to
their barren sands."</p>

<p>A soldier here entered, and prostrating himself,
rose for permission to speak, and then said, "May it
please my lord, the keeper of the wild beasts is in
attendance."</p>

<p>"Let him appear," said the Sultan.</p>

<p>And he was immediately dragged in by two
soldiers, who threw him violently on his face, and then
allowing him to rise to his knees, left him to receive
his orders. The keeper of the wild beasts was a Jew,
for the Moors say, although they do not believe it, that
a lion is of too noble a nature to injure a Jew. He was
a brutal-looking fellow, with a cast in his eye,&mdash;this had
procured him the name of Ain ed Djin, or "Demon-eye;"
he was short and square, with a stunted grey
beard, he wore the black cap, but had put on a white
cloak, and had also fortified himself with copious libations
of brandy to appear before the Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you obeyed my orders, dog?" demanded
the Sultan.</p>

<p>"May my lord live for ever!" said Demon-eye,
"the lion has been without food nearly four-and-twenty
hours, which (may my lord be preserved!) is a long fast,
seeing he was accustomed to two sheep daily. If my
lord (may he be exalted!) had seen him the other day
knock down the donkey, and suck its blood, and afterwards
crunch its bones, with as much ease as my lord
(exalted of God) would a roasted quail." He had got
thus far, with a grin of delight and intoxication on his
inhuman countenance.</p>

<p>"Peace, infidel dog!" thundered the Sultan, "lest
you forthwith share the same fate. Have we nought
better to occupy us but to listen to thy misbegotten
speech? I would fain try the truth of the proverb on
thy vile carcase, and see whether a lion will eat a Jew.
Keep the lion fasting, and have him taken to-morrow
to the old Serai, inside the south wall."</p>

<p>"My lord shall be obeyed," said Ain ed Djin, in
whom the first part of the Sultan's speech had caused
a shudder, regaining his assurance, he continued,
"When he has fasted forty-eight hours, he will give
my lord (whose throne be exalted) satisfaction, and a
fat infidel will be to him as a pistachio nut."</p>

<p>"Slave! Son of a cursed race," exclaimed the
Sultan, "what dog's son art thou, that darest to
pollute our ears with thy drunken words? Ho! the
guards!" and making a sign to them as they entered,
Demon-eye was seized and dragged out, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sobered, and was soon taught by a severe and well-merited
bastinado, administered with the leather thongs
the soldiers wear for the purpose, to be more chary of
his words in future; and when he arose writhing from
his stripes, he was glad to make his escape and execute
his orders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>THE FALCON'S SWOOP.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/006.png" width="70" height="70" alt="I" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">t</span> is very painful to record the fearful trials of
this innocent and helpless girl, but truth
demands it; and I indulge a hope, that, by
drawing attention to the facts, I may enlist the sympathy
of those who may have the power, and will exert
their influence, for the amelioration of the condition of
an unprotected race, and perhaps avert future similar
outrages on our common humanity.</p>

<p>This new project of the Sultan soon became known
through the town, and affected, with surprise and consternation,
the friends who were working for Azora's
deliverance. Ali had already some five-and-twenty of
his followers in the town; these had introduced themselves
as country Arabs with wood, vegetables, or fruit,
for sale, while their horses were led by others personating
horse-dealers. It is true that all strangers on
entering the town were obliged to leave their guns at
the gate with the guard till their exit; but this they
evaded by carrying a second Moorish gun, while their
own shorter pieces were smuggled in, in the loads or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
otherwise. Ali, however, did not feel himself strong
enough for a <i>coup-de-main</i>, and was waiting anxiously
for the chief, who, while his main body were plundering
the provinces, was on his way with a chosen band, with
the intention of carrying a foray to the very gates of
Marocco, as well to intimidate his enemies as to aid at
the same time, whether by stratagem or open force,
in the redemption of his Pledge.</p>

<p>Ain ed Djin, a Jew himself, had informed Rachel
and Ali, who had met him by appointment, of his
orders, but could do nothing to help them. I will
draw a veil over the sufferings of Azora's afflicted
mother. Ali el Bezz was almost at his wits' end,
not but that he would have destroyed every wild beast
in the town rather than fail in his trust, but caution
was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"Could you not poison this lion, O Jew?" said
he.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, O Sheik!" said Demon-eye: "but there
are three others."</p>

<p>"What will kill one will kill four," said Ali.</p>

<p>"And that is true, O my lord," said Demon-eye,
"but then there are the panthers! O Sheik, look at these
stripes upon my back. If one lion died, would here
be still any skin remaining? If more lions died, how
long would the Jew be alive? My head is not so
beautiful as that of Rachel's daughter, but it is as
useful to me; and, Inshallah, I mean to keep
it. Besides, O Sheik!" and here his brutal face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
softened, "I love my lions, and Nasser is a king
of lions, and he knows me. You Arabs love your
horses."</p>

<p>A chord in the Arab's bosom vibrated in unison to
the feeling in the breast of the Jew, and called up
reminiscences, as it were the flash of light upon a picture;
he was for a moment absent, and then his eyes
beamed mildly on the degraded Jew, on whom he had
previously looked with disgust. "God is great!" said
Ali. "But where is this to take place, for I must find
other means?"</p>

<p>"There is an old fondak," said Demon-eye, "about
three hundred yards from the Rahamna gate; it is now
seldom used, except when a cafila of black slaves
comes in."</p>

<p>The Arab's face brightened. "It has a gate
studded with iron, half open," said Ali hastily; "there
is a mulberry-tree in the open space in front, and
you can just see the top of the Kitibea above the
houses. There is a water fountain under the mulberry-tree."</p>

<p>"You know it, O Sheik!" said Ain ed Djin. "But
I hope the Rabbi's daughter will not be obstinate;
better be a Moslem than eaten by a lion. I have seen
these things before, but it never came to blood, for none
can look on the face of a lion, with his eyes fixed
on them, and no bars between, and not tremble and
submit. I will delay to the last, to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Ali had been ruminating, and heard little more
than the end of this speech.</p>

<p>"O woman!" he said to Rachel, with a countenance
which gave assurance to his words; "be of good
cheer, God is merciful, your daughter is safe!"</p>

<p>The building above mentioned, and which was the
same visited by Ali on his entrance into the town,
related in a former chapter, was the arena chosen for
the forthcoming ordeal. Around the centre court a
massive colonnade, connected by Gothic arches, supported
a roofed gallery, running above the building
below; the aisles, formed by the pillars, had originally
been divided into small arched rooms, intended for
shops for merchants; most of these were now in ruins.
The two ends were open, and at the end opposite the
gateway, a double row of columns formed a deep recess
under the gallery. The court-yard, long neglected,
was overgrown here and there with brushwood and
brambles. To this place, on the following day, Ain ed
Djin removed his favourite Nasser; his heavy cage was
placed upon a low truck, and dragged by a number of
Jews pressed into the service. Unaccustomed to this
mode of conveyance, and half famished, the lion made
the crowd tremble with tremendous roars. He was at
length safely lodged in a corner of the court-yard near
the gate, and a cord fastened to the sliding door of the
cage was carried to the gallery above.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the Sultan's
cortege arrived: this was a signal for the crowd to disperse,
their movements being accelerated by the sticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of the guards, and only a limited number of the more
respectable people were admitted.</p>

<p>Azora in the meantime had been brought to the
place in a covered litter in a state of mind impossible
to describe, helpless, hopeless, wishing for death to
relieve her from her misery. Passing through a
crowded part of the bazaars, a ray of hope seemed to
gleam upon her, as she heard a voice call out, "Is the
black horse ready?" and the reply, "All is safe." It
was an assurance that her friends were watchful; but
nothing else occurred until she reached her destination.</p>

<p>A canopied seat had been prepared for the Sultan
over the gateway within, and here he took his place
surrounded by his officers and guards, while Azora was
conducted to the end of the court-yard, and left standing
in the recess under the colonnade. As the attendants
left her, one of them loitered a minute and whispered,
"Fear not, the lion shall not hurt you!" an assurance
which could not affect her conviction that nothing short
of a miracle could save her if the lion was let loose, and
this attempt to raise in her heart a hope impossible
of realization was only an aggravation of her sufferings.</p>

<p>One of the scribes in the Sultan's gallery now rose,
and in a monotonous voice, as if repeating a lesson,
said, "O woman, thou who hast apostatized from the
faith of Islam, which thou didst acknowledge art thou
ready to submit to the mercy of our lord the Khalifa,
and make the profession, 'There is no God but God,
and Mohammed is the Prophet of God?' Behold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lion is ready to be let loose to destroy the unbeliever."
Here the deep, thundrous growling of the impatient
animal came from the cage, to add emphasis to the exhortation
of the Taleb.</p>

<p>The Sultan watched Azora eagerly to detect any
sign of her wavering and appealing to his protection,
but no indication of any change in her resolve met his
eye. She stood absorbed, her hands clasped before
her, and her eyes fixed on the ground. Suddenly
rousing herself as she heard the blasphemy imputed
to her, the spirit of the martyr became strong within
her, she stood erect in her enthusiasm, and a halo of
glory seemed visibly to surround her, as looking up
with one hand aloft and the other pressed to her
bosom, she exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lord he is the God! The Lord he is the
God!"</p>

<p>"Let loose the lion!" said the Sultan; and the
door of the den was drawn up.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. The lion first put his
huge head cautiously forward, and looked about, but
seeming ashamed of his fear he stepped boldly out and
walked majestically to the middle of the space; here
shaking out his mane to double its volume, he stood
still,&mdash;a magnificent monster; then he looked slowly
all round until his deadly eyes rested on the fragile
girl. All held their breath, while the blood ran cold
to every man's heart at this fearful sight.</p>

<p>Poor Azora, though prepared for the worst, seeing
herself almost within the grasp of this powerful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
merciless brute, now frowning fiercely upon her, shook
with a pang of terror, which the bravest man must
have felt in her position. It could not shake her
resolve of dying for her faith, but she mentally prayed
to that God who had delivered the prophet from the
lions, to aid her in her extremity. The lion at first
appeared surprised at being offered a prey, to whose
species he had been so long subject. He stood glaring
on the unfortunate girl and lashing his sides with his
tail, when his instinct suggesting to him that some
cunning was necessary to secure his victim, he walked
away, apparently regardless of her presence, until hid
from her by one of the large columns among the ruins,
when, taking advantage of its concealment, he turned
short round, and, creeping a few paces, uttered a tremendous
roar, and sprang with a terrific bound towards
his intended victim. A cry of horror burst
involuntarily from all who witnessed this inhuman
scene!</p>

<p>Azora's nature was no longer able to bear up
against the horrors of her situation; drawing her
hands convulsively to her bosom, her eyes distended,
and shrinking instinctively from his fatal spring she
sunk senseless and fainting to the earth. It was the
work of a moment; but before the lion reached her a
double shot had sent two balls through his body, and
the noble animal rolled over within five yards of her,
pierced to the heart, and in the agonies of death. A
natural feeling of relief came over the spectators notwithstanding
their fanaticism, and they were probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not displeased at the change of victims; but the Sultan
could not contain his rage at this unexpected and
daring interposition.</p>

<p>"Seize the traitor!" he shouted. "Five hundred
gold pieces for the man who fired the shot!"</p>

<p>And the crowd poured in at the gate, some to
search for the offender, and some to look at the dying
lion.</p>

<p>Among these was poor Ain ed Djin, who sat down
and took the enormous head of his pet on his knees
till it had ceased to breathe. He made a shrewd guess
at the author of his death, but though he loved the
lion, his attachment to his race was paramount, and
there was no danger of his betraying him.</p>

<p>Azora, as soon as she was restored, was sent back
in the litter in which she came. The Sultan was
convinced that his experiment was a complete failure,
and, not prepared to carry further so illegal a mode of
procedure, resolved to hand her over to the sentence of
the law.</p>

<p>The parties searching the court-yard were attracted
by a cloud of smoke resting on one of the thickets,
and on searching the spot they discovered the well;
and near its mouth they found a double gun, its butt
on the ground, and the barrel resting on a forked stick
planted in the earth, with a string attached to the
triggers, and passing out into the court-yard. "El
Aarb" (an Arab) passed from mouth to mouth, for
they alone use double guns. A man now descended
the well, but reported no egress, a mass of rock blocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
up the passage into the underground canal. All
these circumstances went to prove that the animal had
been killed by a spring gun. This was reported to
the Sultan as the fact, with which he was fain to be
satisfied for the present. There was one in attendance,
however, who was not so easily satisfied about
the catastrophe of the lion's death as the Sultan; this
was Abdslem: he and Hassan had not been so long
plotting together without being acquainted with each
other's secrets, and it was perfectly plain to him that
the passage to the well had been made use of for
bringing about the termination to the scene they had
just witnessed. He knew of Hassan's repentance,
and who but he was interested in saving Azora, and
who else was acquainted with the passage? He had no
doubt in his mind but that Hassan was the culprit,
and his belief was confirmed on looking round and
finding that he was absent. They had latterly avoided
each other, but Abdslem's cupidity was excited by the
offered reward of the Sultan; and while all were searching
or busy on the spot, he quitted the fondak alone,
and made his way to the town gate with the intention
of intercepting Hassan at the pit outside the
walls.</p>

<p>Hassan, who had been horrified at the ordeal he
heard was preparing for Azora, had remained at home,
but at length unable to restrain his anxiety with
respect to the success of Ali's project for her deliverance,
he had wandered away outside the town; and
soon after arriving near the fosse he heard the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the Arab's gun, and he retired and sat down under
a tree to wait for him. A quarter of an hour had
passed and Ali came not, but presently hearing some
one approach he turned round, and saw it was his
former ally Abdslem; this alarmed Hassan on Ali's
account, but before he could decide on the mode of
getting rid of him, Abdslem addressed him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have travelled that road before together."</p>

<p>"What road, O unwelcome one?" said Hassan.</p>

<p>"Underground," said Abdslem, jeeringly.</p>

<p>"Where you will soon be, O evil-eyed one, if
you do not go whence you came. I know not what
you talk of."</p>

<p>"How should you, O poor man?" said Abdslem;
"you know nothing of the wonderful case in the
fondak? You cannot shoot lions; we do not know the
well; and here you are taken in the fact?"</p>

<p>Hassan's eye was beginning to glow.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou not go thy ways, O accursed one? I
want not thy company."</p>

<p>"I know it, O darweesh!" said Abdslem, "but
I want yours. In the name of the Sultan I summon
you. Follow me."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! the Sultan! O son of a black father,
go! Return&mdash;I follow not a slave."</p>

<p>Abdslem derived courage from the knowledge that
if he killed Hassan, he would not only be justified
but rewarded. He therefore advanced upon him,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come you must; it is the Sultan's command."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Hassan had sprung to his feet, Abdslem rushed
upon him, and a struggle ensued; Abdslem was the
stronger man, and coming prepared, his dagger was
first in his hand, and after a short struggle both came
to the ground, Hassan under.</p>

<p>"Will you surrender?" said Abdslem, holding
down Hassan's dagger hand, while he raised his own
to strike.</p>

<p>"Never!" grinned Hassan, glaring upon him and
catching his uplifted arm.</p>

<p>Abdslem's whole attention was engaged in the
struggle, and he was thus prevented from noticing
the presence of Ali el Bezz, who during this time had
emerged from the pit and approached them. But
what was his dismay on hearing a voice repeat the
warning of the Duquela gate, "Beware the Falcon's
swoop!" and looking up terror-struck, he met the stern
glance of his former prisoner, who stood over him, and
before he could recover from his surprise Ali's ataghan
was buried in his throat.</p>

<p>As Abdslem fell, Hassan arose.</p>

<p>"May you be rewarded, O my friend!" he said.
"The slave was too strong for me; but Azora&mdash;is
she saved?"</p>

<p>"Saved!" said Ali; "the lion is dead, and the
Sultan's beard is defiled."</p>

<p>"And suppose the pan had flashed," said Hassan,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Both shots would not have failed; the worst
is, I have lost an old friend, for I was forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
leave my good gun, to deceive the Sultan's slipper-hunters."</p>

<p>"But," said Hassan, "why did you delay, they
will find the well, and you will be pursued?"</p>

<p>"Dost thou see Sheik Ali's ears growing," he
said, "that I should lock the door and give my enemy
the key? Before I took my station I had filled up
the passage with the exception of space for me to pass,
and a big rock was loosened ready to shut that, so I
waited when all was done to see if they intended to
open the way. But, no! one came down&mdash;I could
have touched him through the crevices, and he shouts,
'There is no passage; the rocks of creation are here;
it is a trap gun.' Oh, that Moslems should be such
fools; may their houses be desolate!"</p>

<p>"God is wonderful," said Hassan, "and this
lying witness, is he not accursed? But stop! if I go
now, and retract my perjury, there will be no witness
against her."</p>

<p>"I see not, O friend, how that can help her, they
have the writing sworn. But what think you the
Sultan cares for your witness? his will is law."</p>

<p>"No! he dare not," said Hassan, "the witnesses
must be present, or her blood will be on the
people."</p>

<p>"Trust it not; the eagle wants no witness against
the dove; but what shall we do with this?" said Ali,
pointing to the body.</p>

<p>"Cast him into the pit," said Hassan, "he may
be wanted, and I can find him; he knew the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
before, this is the last time he will use it;" and taking
him between them they swung him over the side, and
the body went crashing through the boughs to the
bottom of the pit.</p>

<p>It was now getting late, and Ali promising to meet
Hassan at his house after dark, they parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>RETRIBUTION.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/007.png" width="70" height="70" alt="H" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">assan</span> returned to his home, a prey to remorse.
Azora had escaped this time, but
the final scene awaited her. Men's motives
are of a mixed nature, and difficult to analyse. I do
not assume that he was solely moved by the stings of
conscience, or that he had any great horror of perjury
in the abstract; but, however the customs of a country
may modify the modes of expressing the feelings, and
of acting under their guidance, there is no doubt that
he entertained for Azora a pure and ardent love.
Prompted by his false friend and urged on by his
passion, he had adopted the only course which appeared
to him capable of compassing his end, without
calculating the obstacles which might arise, and which
he could not foresee, and when the full view of the
consequences of his act was forced upon him he was
appalled. Not only to lose one he loved so deeply,
but to feel that he, who would willingly have sacrificed
his life for her, had been the means of bringing her
to an awful and cruel death; it was more than his
mind could bear. Azora's forgiveness was no relief to
him in the bitterness of his grief; the more he felt the
innocence and purity of her nature, the deeper he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the enormity of his own guilt, in devoting such an angel
to destruction; reproaches, even curses, he could have
borne, her gentleness and forgiveness were intolerable.</p>

<p>To-night, as he entered his dwelling, he felt a
gloomy foreboding, as if some heavy retribution were
hanging over him. His little sister,&mdash;a bright creature
with hazel eyes and a laughing face,&mdash;ran to meet him.
The care of this child had devolved upon him since
the death of his parents, and she was now coming
to the age when her playful and affectionate manners
began to reward him for his care and protection; his
little darling sprang joyfully into his arms, and kissed
his cold lips; he clasped her to his breast, and felt a
transient feeling of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy we might have been," he said,
half aloud,&mdash;"lost!&mdash;lost!" and the conviction of
his misery overpowered every other sensation. He
smoothed back the silken tresses from her fair forehead,
and gazed on her sweet face, talking almost
involuntarily. "Once I was like you,&mdash;innocent,&mdash;but
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you ill, brother dear?" said the child,
putting its arms round his neck. "Brother, don't play
with me, but brother is pale,&mdash;not well, and I don't
want to play. If you are sick, I shall cry all night."</p>

<p>"No, love," said Hassan, shrinking from her innocent
scrutiny, "I am not sick, but very tired; and now
it is time for you to go to bed; is it not late?"</p>

<p>The child allowed itself to be put to bed quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in the adjoining room, the door of which was left ajar,
that Hassan might hear if she wanted anything during
the night. He was now alone, he tried in vain to
make light of the weight, and cast off the gloom
which oppressed his spirits, and he sat with his hands
pressed to his forehead harrowed with inward suffering;
presently a ghastly smile overspread his features,
as a horrible thought presented itself to his mind, and
he drew his dagger with a convulsive start. "Thus,
then, I can escape this load of misery," said he, gazing
at its keen tapering point. "Why should man live
and suffer with such an antidote as this?&mdash;But stop!
will not this add another crime to my account? And
I may yet be of service to Azora. O Azora, Azora!
what woe has not your love brought upon me? And
alas! upon you. And who, when I am gone, will take
care of this sweet child?" As these thoughts succeeded
each other, his resolution gradually gave way,
and with a shudder he hurled the weapon of death to
the other end of the room. A shrill, prolonged scream
of infant agony instantly burst on his ears; and as he
sprang aghast to the spot, his little sister fell writhing
at his feet transfixed by the deadly steel. The child
had been impressed with the idea that her brother
was ill; and when she heard him talking to himself,
and so uneasy, with child-like curiosity she crept
quietly from her bed, and had just entered the half-open
door, when she was struck by the fatal dagger,
and fell deluged in blood.</p>

<p>Hassan remained fixed to the spot, paralysed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
horror, his eyes starting from their sockets, his mouth
open, his hands clenched, a petrified image of despair.
For some minutes he seemed not to breathe; presently
he dropped on his knees, he raised the child's head,
and pressed his lips to hers; the blood oozed from the
pressure and ran a crimson stream down her neck,
staining her silken hair; his lips were damp with her
blood; his brain, already shaken, could no longer bear
up against the shock, gasping for breath he fell senseless
on the floor. Gradually, after some time, sensation
returned, but when it did, his reason had left him.
He sat up, and looked round the room with a vacant
stare, till his eye rested on the body of the child; this
recalled the lost thread of his thoughts; snatching the
dagger from the wound, he sprang to his feet with
a heart-freezing yell, as he brandished it aloft.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! fiends, are ye content? No! I
come! I come! Shower down upon me the burning
rafters of hell!&mdash;O Azora, you are avenged! God, how
my heart burns, it is like a ball of fire in my bosom,
and this red-tempered steel will fuse, ere it pierce it.
Lo, I come!"</p>

<p>His hand was already raised to accomplish his
purpose, when Ali, who had just entered, rushed forward
and wrenched the dagger from his grasp, in
doing which he stumbled against the child.</p>

<p>"Hassan! what mean you? Whose work is this?
Are you mad?"</p>

<p>Hassan sprang frantically forward&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mad, did you say?" he yelled; "mad! aye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
mad! mad! mad!" and he dashed himself on the
earth and howled hideously in a paroxysm of fury.
Ali perceived at once that his reason had given way,
and supposed that he had destroyed his sister in the
blindness of his rage. Leaving him to exhaust himself
where he lay, Ali removed the body to the adjoining
room, and having washed away the stains from the
floor, he sat down to consider the best course to adopt
to prevent harm to Hassan or himself on account of
the crime of the former. He was fearful of exciting
Hassan by asking an explanation; but from this he was
saved by Hassan himself, who now rose slowly from
the ground, and looked with a long searching glance
round the room. His appearance was frightful; his
turban had fallen off, exposing his shaven head; his
pallid face, stained with blood, contrasted with his
black moustaches and glittering eyes; the veins in his
neck and temples were swollen to bursting,&mdash;his whole
face distorted. The stout heart of the Arab could not
divest him of a superstitious misgiving, as he looked
on the figure of his friend; he, lately so calm, now the
prey of insanity.</p>

<p>Hassan pressed his hands to his eyes, to try and
realise the past, and then stood wreathing and winding
his fingers together.</p>

<p>"Horrid dream! what art thou?" he said, in a
hollow voice, and turning to Ali, "O Moslem, let me
remember; yes, she is safe. O Azora, thou art safe!
Methought I returned home&mdash;home? My destiny was
darkened&mdash;clouds and darkness were over me. Methought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
my little darling flew into my arms&mdash;I kissed
her. Ha! again! is it blood? No! no! I dream
still! I laid her in her bed&mdash;she sleeps&mdash;no noise&mdash;she
sleeps! I laid my burning brow on the table; I
thought it would have burnt into it. When I lifted
my eyes, Iblis stood before me. My dagger was in
my hand. 'Strike!' he said." Here Hassan twisted
his hands more eagerly, and his whole frame was trembling.
"The keen blade glittered like a lambent
moonbeam; I sprang to my feet. Satan avaunt! I
cast it from me. Ha! what do I hear? the demoniac
laugh of the retreating fiend, and the agonized cry of
my murdered child. There she is, see, at my feet&mdash;bleeding&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>Large drops followed one another down the brow
and face of Hassan, but he was deadly calm, and
seemed to repeat the words from memory, but to have
no feeling of their meaning.</p>

<p>Ali, finding he did not relapse, took advantage of
the pause to soothe his spirits and divert his thoughts&mdash;it
was needless. His memory just recollected the bare
outline of the scene, but without consciousness, and he
did not even ask for his sister.</p>

<p>"God has smitten the oppressors of the innocent,"
muttered Ali, while Hassan fell into an apathetic
stupor; reaction of the violent emotions which had so
shaken him. Ali had now to consider what was best
to be done; Hassan could no further co-operate with
him, and for him to present himself to the authorities
under any circumstances would ensure his destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Ali wrote on a piece of paper, "Hassan Ibn Ibrahim,
possessed with an evil spirit, slew his sister," and after
removing Hassan's dagger, and everything he might
make use of to injure himself, he took the child's body,
and, during the night, left it with the billet at the gate
of the Cadi, knowing that, when discovered in the
morning, inquiry would be made, the truth be apparent,
and the affair hushed up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<small>THE PLEDGE REDEEMED.</small></h2>

<div class="figcap"><img src="images/004.png" width="70" height="70" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dcap">s</span> soon as they arrived at the cultivated districts,
which they did by rapid marches, the
Arabs spread themselves over the country,
plundering in all directions. For this purpose they
dispersed by tribes, the whole body uniting for the
night at a rendezvous previously fixed upon. The peasants
fled everywhere on their approach, securing what
property they had time to remove, into the towns and
walled villages. These, the Arabs being all horsemen,
left unmolested. They carried off all the grain that
could be discovered, and even reaped what was on the
ground, compelling the peasants to assist in threshing
it out; they also gathered the dates from the trees.
Their plunder was loaded on camels and mules, seized
on their route. Wherever they bivouacked, their horses
were picketed in the standing corn, and very soon
changed their appearance from the bony, game-looking
animals that they were at starting, to rounded, sleek
chargers. The cultivated tracts they passed over were
left as if a swarm of locusts had swept over the land.
After issuing the necessary orders to the Sheiks left in
command, and directing their course on the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of Rahamna, Sheik Hamed selected five hundred of his
best horsemen, and started by forced marches for
Marocco, having received an urgent message from Ali
that no time was to be lost if he wished to be assured
of redeeming his word. About fifty miles south of the
city, the Chief knew that he would find a tribe of Arabs,
who, although settled in the province, kept up a friendly
intercourse with the original desert stock. From the
douar of this tribe, he could march by a straight course
much faster than any messenger who might be on his
way to give notice of their approach; and by avoiding
any molestation of the peasants on the march, through
a sparsely populated and thickly-wooded country, very
little alarm would be excited. It was the day before
the execution that the Chief arrived at this place, called
Ras el Ain, early in the morning. He did not inform
his hosts of the object of his visit, but as rumours of
the irruption of the tribes had reached even to Marocco,
they were supposed to be a reconnoitring party. After
resting all day, hospitably entertained by the tribe, the
Chief called to horse at sunset, and made a night
march of forty miles, stopping in the woods, within ten
miles of the town, where were some springs, among
masses of rock. The forest trees were high, and interspersed
with glades; but in a place so utterly unfrequented,
that any number of horsemen might have
been easily concealed. By travelling single file from this
spot, the band could debouch on the plain within two
miles of the gates of the town. Yusuf was sent on at
once from here, to apprise Rachel of the approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
succour, as, whether the plans of the Chief succeeded
or failed, it would not be safe for either of them to
remain within the Sultan's power; they were therefore
to repair to this place, where one hundred horsemen
would be left in reserve. Yusuf was also to communicate
with Ali, who was waiting impatiently for tidings
of the Chief. In case of his failing to arrive, Ali would
certainly have attempted the rescue, with his small
band; but then there was the danger of being pursued
by the Moors, who would have been encouraged by the
weakness of his numbers, whereas, against a larger
force, they would not venture to leave the protection of
their walls, until after tedious preparation and the collection
of an army.</p>

<p>The day appointed for the accomplishing of the
martyrdom of Azora had arrived. The Sultan was
sitting in the M'Shouar, attended by his guards, while
on carpets near him sat the Wezeer and scribes,&mdash;one
of these was preparing the warrant of execution for the
Sultan's seal. The order set forth that she was to be
taken outside the gates, at the hour of mid-day prayer,
and to be burnt alive at the stake as an apostate from
the faith of Islam. The audience-hall, which was supported
by pillars, opened in front on a large public
place, to which the people had access, and here a considerable
crowd was collected, attracted by the novelty
of the case. As a mob, they were eager for the excitement
of an execution; this, in the present instance,
was enhanced by their fanaticism, and they looked
forward to the burning of an infidel with peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
gratification. The crowd, however, maintained a respectful
distance, and any breach of order brought on
them an indiscriminate shower of blows from the sticks
of the black soldiers. Those who came on business of
importance, or had causes to be heard, were allowed to
enter the hall, one at a time. While the preliminaries
of this judicial murder were being effected, there was
a movement among the crowd, and a man, in a hooded
burnoose, walked slowly into the audience-hall; he
held a staff in his hand, and from his wrist hung, by
a thong, a mace headed by an iron ball, studded with
spikes, such as is often carried by mendicant fakeers.</p>

<p>"What is his business?" said the Sultan, as he
stood before him.</p>

<p>The stranger allowed the hood of his cloak to fall
from his head, and discovered the pale, wild features of
Hassan. He fixed his eyes, glittering with the fire of
insanity, on the Sultan.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know me?" said he, slowly, whilst all
present trembled for his life, "I am Hassan Ibn Ibrahim:
but where is my father? He died in the tyrant's
prison. Where is my father's house? I&mdash;I alone,
remain, and I care not how soon you send me to
their graves: but first I have an errand. Hear, O
Moslemin!" he said, raising his voice, "I come here
to confess my perjury. That woman, that child of
God, that you are here assembled to murder, is innocent&mdash;I
(may I be accursed!) accused her falsely. I
retract&mdash;I demand her freedom. Let the law judge
my crime."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Maniacs are looked upon by the Moors with reverential
awe, and allowed to roam at large. They are
believed to be possessed by spirits, by whose inspiration
they speak. The Sultan quailed under the gaze of
the madman; but, though boiling with rage at being
thus thwarted in his sanguinary purpose, he controlled
himself; and, more to justify himself to the people,
than supposing the maniac could understand him, he
said, mildly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is too late; your accusation was written and
sworn: and supposing you were guilty of perjury, as
you say, but which is to be doubted, yet the other
witness maintaining his word, your present falsehood
is useless."</p>

<p>The maniac's features worked wildly, and his eyes
flashed, while the Sultan was speaking. The mildness
of his reception had inspired him with greater boldness.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" he yelled. "Iblis whispered me
this, and told me to come prepared."</p>

<p>He threw open his cloak, and produced a bundle,
enveloped in the embroidered scarf lately given by the
Sultan to Abdslem.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know that scarf?" he continued, "did
it not belong to the false witness? And if he does not
admit himself a perjured slave and confess the innocence
of Azora, his accursed tongue will never again say that
she is guilty.&mdash;Behold!" and unrolling the scarf with
a jerk, the ghastly head of Abdslem fell on the Sultan's
carpet.</p>

<p>The eyes of the maniac literally blazed with rapture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
on beholding the effect he had produced, he ground his
teeth, and the foam flew from his mouth.</p>

<p>"There!&mdash;there!" he shouted, rushing towards the
Sultan, then suddenly stopping and pointing to it
with his staff&mdash;"ask him&mdash;behold your witness&mdash;does
he accuse her? then I must answer for him," said he,
raising his voice to the highest pitch. "I swear that
she is innocent, and every fiend in hell re-echoes, 'She
is innocent!'"</p>

<p>The Sultan, though restrained by superstition,
hardly considered himself safe in such close proximity
to the madman, yet did not wish to evince his alarm,
but his hand went mechanically into his vest for a
pistol or dagger. This movement did not escape the
eye of the maniac&mdash;he yelled a hideous laugh, that
thrilled the hearts of his hearers.</p>

<p>"Ha! he fears me, he is a Sultan&mdash;but guilt always
fears. You slew my father, why should you not fear
me? My sister!"</p>

<p>His brain seethed as the horrid vision of her death
flashed on his broken intellect, and he gazed an instant
at his clenched hands.</p>

<p>"Yes! her blood is upon them."</p>

<p>The vision passed as it came, and he spoke again in
calm tones as of reason.</p>

<p>"I warn you that you are in danger; I devote you
to human vengeance and divine wrath! For the last
time I demand Azora's liberation."</p>

<p>The Sultan's patience was at length exhausted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
"Seize him, and off with his head!" he thundered
springing up.</p>

<p>Frenzy again blazed in the eye of Hassan: "Stop!"
he shouted, as he dropped on his knee; "and may the
curse of Mohammed and the Seven Sleepers cleave to
the man that lays a hand on me!" then, springing to
his feet, and swinging his mace round his head, he
uttered a prolonged yell of triumph, and rushed
through the crowd that recoiled terror-struck to open
him a passage, and his shouts of vengeance rang in
their ears until they died away in the distance.</p>

<p>This incident was not calculated to influence the
Sultan's decision, but rather to increase his irritation
against his victim. It would hardly have altered his
resolve had the two witnesses come, like Judas, and
said, "We have sinned, in that we have betrayed the
innocent blood." But one being dead, and the other
a madman, it left the case exactly as it stood.</p>

<p>At mid-day the fatal procession left the town by the
Rahamna gate. First walked the Cadi and his secretaries,
a green banner being carried before him: then
followed the condemned martyr, in a long linen veil,
surrounded by some thirty or forty guards, on foot
and on horseback. Then came the executioners with
torches, ropes, and long knives, a large crowd of horse
and foot from the town followed. As they left the
gate, they raised the usual chaunt, "La Illaw Il Allah,
Mohammed er rasool Allaw." This was taken up by
the crowd, and the poor girl's heart sunk within her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
she had not lost all hope, as she had received intimations,
not very clear, that an attempt would be made to deliver
her, and she started as she heard the following words,
from two men in the crowd, just outside the guards,
"<i>Is the black horse saddled?</i>" and the reply, "<i>Ay, Inshallah!
and will win.</i>" She remembered the signal of
her escape from the lion, and she hoped almost against
hope, but in any case she was prepared to meet her God.</p>

<p>"Where is the race?" said Abd el Aziz, who was
one of the guards, deceived by the stranger's speech.</p>

<p>"The other side of the town, O Ka&iuml;d!" said the
stranger; "we had a wager on our horses, but followed
this crowd, to see the execution, but my heart sickens
at the thought of it&mdash;a woman too!"</p>

<p>"I don't like it myself," said Abd el Aziz, "but
I am a slave of the Sultan, his word must stand. If
it had been a man&mdash;I know this one, and the infidel is
beautiful. May I not be unmanned and shame my
beard&mdash;you are not a Marokshi."</p>

<p>"No! I am from Rif," said the horseman.</p>

<p>"Rif!" said Abd el Aziz, "you are all pirates in
Rif&mdash;and you pretend to be soft-hearted."</p>

<p>"There are pirates in Rif, O Ka&iuml;d, and there are
thieves in Marocco, but there are mountaineers in Rif,
who never saw the sea. I heard that the witnesses
against this infidel had retracted."</p>

<p>"How could that be?" said Abd el Aziz; "Hassan,
who is possessed with a devil, came to the M'Shouar
and brought his friend's head under his arm to confirm
him; but as one could not speak, and the devil spoke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the other, the Sultan was only more savage; he would
have killed Hassan, had it pleased God, but who would
touch a Majnoon?"</p>

<p>"Inshallah!" said the stranger, "I cannot stand
this burning, and you say she is beautiful." Then raising
his voice, he said, "<i>The black horse is waiting.</i>
If she is innocent, God will send her deliverance&mdash;Peace."</p>

<p>"Inshallah!" repeated Abd el Aziz, "when the
mountain comes to our lord Mohammed;" and our
friend Ali, dressed as a Moor, turned back with his companion,
and galloped across the plain to a date-grove,
where he had collected his followers; they were partly
screened from observation, but as they were all dressed
as Moors, any passers-by supposed them to be a troop
of the Sultan's soldiers on some duty, more especially
as they guarded a woman's litter carried between two
stout mules. One of the party was stationed in the
top of a date-tree which overlooked the plain, and reported
every thing that took place; he could see the
preparations at the place of execution, and give early
notice of any movement in the distance.</p>

<p>On a slight rising ground, about half a mile from
the gates, the pile of wood had been raised. It was
about eight feet high, built up around a stake fixed in
the ground. The wood being a species of cedar was
very inflammable, and to make it more so a quantity
of pitch and turpentine had been added to it. A little
apart, under the shade of a large tree, carpets had been
spread for the Cadi and his party; here he took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
seat, attended by the horsemen, while the foot-soldiers
kept clear the space around the pile. It would be a
slander on the better classes of the Moors, to suppose
that they felt any of the pleasure of inquisitors, in
witnessing, or being actors in, a tragedy like the present,
on the contrary they were not only impressed
with its impolicy, but shocked by its inhumanity and
cruelty. Cases had occurred in which young Jews, in
a fit of temporary irritation, arising out of family
quarrels, had really apostatized, but had been allowed
on proper representations made, accompanied by the
judicious expenditure of money, to return to their own
people; and so might Azora, but for the curse of
beauty.</p>

<p>The Jews, for the most part, remained within doors,
mourning for their sister, and bewailing the captivity
of their people; but some few had gone out of the
gate, afraid to approach, but standing afar off to see
the end of the martyr to their faith.</p>

<p>Azora was first taken before the Cadi, and a crier
called out the names of the witnesses, her accusers, but
no one answered; after a pause, the names were again
called, and again a third time without answer. The
Cadi then produced his records, and the sworn deposition
was read out. After this he read out the warrant
of the Sultan for her execution. The old man's voice
trembled and he looked wistfully in Azora's face in
hopes of seeing some sign of her recantation. She
was deadly pale, but as a sheep before her shearers, she
was dumb, and they led her away to be burnt. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pile her veil was taken off, and her face was as the face
of an angel. With the exception of the brutified executioners,
there were very few, even to the rough soldiers,
who were not in tears.</p>

<p>Sheik Ali in the meantime was in a state of the
most intense anxiety, on account of the delay of the
Chief. As soon as he arrived at the ambush, he never
took his eyes from the look-out, who sat among the feathery
fronds of the date-tree, and reported what he
saw in broken sentences.</p>

<p>"What seest thou, O brother?" said Ali.</p>

<p>"Nothing, O Sheik! The procession passes on."</p>

<p>"And in the distance?&mdash;your eyes were wont to be
good," said Ali.</p>

<p>"Nothing, O Sheik! The plain is white;&mdash;the procession
has arrived;&mdash;the green flag of Islam is planted
near a tree.&mdash;Two vultures have risen from the woods,
on the south of the plain.&mdash;The woman is being taken
towards the pile of wood."</p>

<p>"Mount!" said Ali, becoming desperate, and
every man was in his saddle.</p>

<p>"A jackal has broken from the wood," resumed
the scout, "it crosses the plain&mdash;looking back.&mdash;Now
I think I see our people;&mdash;they emerge from the woods;&mdash;they
are forming outside;&mdash;a body is left in reserve;&mdash;I
see the Chief at the head of his band! Lo! they
come!"</p>

<p>And the next minute he had slid to the ground.</p>

<p>Azora stood on the pile, in relief against the clear
sky; one of the executioners was preparing the ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to attach her to the stake, while the other stood by
with the torch awaiting the order from the Cadi to
fire the pile. Suddenly there was a movement of
alarm among the crowd, and Azora's eye brightened,
as, looking across the plain in the direction in which
they swayed, she saw a cloud of dust approaching from
the south; immediately afterwards a cry was raised,
"El Aarb! El Aarb! Fly! fly! The Arabs! the
Arabs!" and in a few minutes the whole crowd was
flying across the plain which separated them from the
town, and streaming towards the gates like frightened
cattle. Down came the dark mass of cavalry charging
at full speed; the earth shook, and from three hundred
voices rose above the noise and screams of the
crowd the wild shout, "Allaw ho Ackbar!" Onward
came the Arabs, in every variety of costume, turbans,
and burnooses, from the marauding expedition, put
over their blue shirts; their guns poised, they swept
over the comparatively abandoned space, separating
as they passed the pile; they trampled on or struck
down the affrighted stragglers, and wheeling, brought
up beyond. The Chief, with Sheik Ayoub, were in
the centre of the charge, and checking their speed as
they came up, Ayoub sprang from his saddle to the
top of the pile, and cutting with his ataghan the
cords with which he had already begun to bind his
victim, he dashed the executioner to the earth; the
dogged villain, enraged at losing his prey, was up
the next minute, and climbing the wood pile on the
other side, dagger in hand to rush on Azora, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was confronted by the glaring eye of Hassan the
maniac, who with one blow of his mace shattered his
skull, and hurled him, this time, lifeless to the ground.
In the meantime, the other executioner, inspired by
the hate of fanaticism, before he attempted to escape,
threw his torch into the prepared pile, which was instantly
in a blaze; he was cut down and trampled
under foot; but there was no time to be lost, and
Azora, half fainting, was lowered down and placed in
the litter, which had been sent forward by Ali.</p>

<p>Ali, while this had been going on, had not been
idle; emerging from the grove, with a plume of black
ostrich-feathers carried on a spear, to distinguish him
to his tribesmen, he galloped down and surrounded
the party of cavalry round the Cadi. Being dressed as
Moors, these at first supposed they were friends come to
their assistance, until they found themselves each with
a double-barrel at his breast, and before they could
recover from their surprise, they were all disarmed,
and their horses hobbled; the Cadi and his scribes
wondering whether it was written that their throats
were to be cut by the Arabs.</p>

<p>"Resistance is useless," said Ali to the soldiers.</p>

<p>"You have seen me before, O my lord the Cadi!"
and Al Maimon's face was as white as his beard at
finding himself in the power of one who was looked on
as an afreet, and who had so often escaped from his
sentences.</p>

<p>"Ali el Bezz!" he ejaculated, "O Sheik! I know
you. God is merciful&mdash;I am an old man&mdash;I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
wronged you&mdash;I give sentence according to law&mdash;but
revenge is yours! Let me say the Fetha, and take
my life&mdash;if it is written."</p>

<p>"Truly, O Al Maimon, you deserve to die, as an
unjust judge. Do you not pervert the holy Koran for
your purposes? Do you not take bribes to rob God's
children, the widow and orphan? and are you not now
here to shed innocent blood? But your victim is safe,
and we have taught you the difference between Moorish
law and Arab justice. I will not have your blood on
my hands, when your grey beard will so soon be
burning in Djehennem. You will presently be free.
Show mercy, as you have received it. And tell your
Sultan we laugh at his beard."</p>

<p>"O Sheik!" said Abd el Aziz, "the black horse
has won the race."</p>

<p>Their attention was now attracted by a succession
of yells from the burning pyre: "Woe unto you,
Moslim! Woe unto you, murderers! Woe! woe!
Slay, O Sheik! cut them down! spare none! The
Prophet's curse on them! Woe! woe!" And they
beheld Hassan the maniac on the summit of the pile,
now wrapped in flames, with his arms wildly waving,
and shouting his curses. The Chief would have saved
him, but Hassan, unable to distinguish friend from
foe, warned them off: "Woe unto you, murderers; you
shall not take me alive! Death to the slave who
approaches! Slay, O Ali!"&mdash;Here the smoke and
flame rolled upward, and choked his utterance, and
his voice broke into gurgling and spasmodic screams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as the fire wrapped him round, and his clothes and
hair were fiercely ablaze. On the same spot where the
vision of the Hebrew maiden had just before appeared
against the sky, now stood forth the burning and
appalling form of her accuser. He stood erect, one
blackened arm pointing towards the band, the other
wound round the glowing stake, a figure of horror.
With a dying effort, as the wind blew the smoke from
his face, he sent up a last sad cry, "O Azora! Azora!
saved! saved! Allaw ho Ackbar!" and sank devoured
in the flaming pyre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The crowd had disappeared within the town gates,
with the exception of some dozen maimed, who had
been ridden down by the Arabs' charge. Leaving the
Cadi and his party at liberty, the whole band resumed
their march, escorting the litter by the way they came.
The sun shone on the vacant plain, on the black
smouldering pile, on the whispering date-groves, and
on the mud walls of the town, now manned with excited
spectators, who did not, however, venture out,
until the band of the Arab Chief, who had so nobly
redeemed his Pledge, gradually disappeared behind the
distant woods.</p>
